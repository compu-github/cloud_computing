Jared Polis announced the commutation of Rogel Aguilera-Mederos' sentence Thursday.\"I am writing to inform you that I am granting your application for a commutation,\" Polis wrote. \"After learning about the highly atypical and unjust sentence in your case, I am commuting your sentence to 10 years and granting you parole eligibility on December 30, 2026.\"MORE: Truck driver's mother vows to keep fighting as judge reconsiders her son's controversial 110-year sentenceAttorney James Colgan, who represented Mederos during the trial, said in a statement to ABC News: \"Justice was served!!! This commutation is far more reflective of the crime than 110 years. This type of justice is exactly why I went to law school and why I continue to practice law! Mr. Mederos will be forever grateful for the millions of people that supported him.\"Mederos was sentenced on Dec. 13 to 110 years in prison for a 2019 fatal crash on Interstate 70, outside Denver, that killed four people and injured several others -- a sentence the judge said he wouldn't have chosen if he had the discretion. Mederos testified that his brakes failed, but he was driving 85 mph when the speed limit was 45 mph and he drove past a runaway truck ramp before plowing into stopped traffic, police said.He was found guilty by a Jefferson County jury of 27 counts -- the most serious was first-degree assault, a class-three felony.The number of the charges, mandatory minimum laws and a classification that mandates some sentences be served consecutively resulted in the lengthy sentence.\"The length of your 110-year sentence is simply not commensurate with your actions, nor with penalties handed down to others for similar crimes,\" Polis said in his letter. \"There is an urgency to remedy this unjust sentence and restore confidence in the uniformity and fairness of our criminal justice system, and consequently I have chosen to commute your sentence now.\"Story continuesJefferson County District Attorney Alexis King had filed a motion earlier this month asking for a sentence of 20 to 30 years instead, and a hearing to reconsider the sentence had been scheduled for Jan. 13, 2022. King said she was \"disappointed in the governor's decision to act prematurely.\"\"I joined the surviving victims and families of those who lost their loved ones in their wish to have the trial judge determine an appropriate sentence in this case, as he heard the facts and evidence of the defendant's destructive conduct that led to death, injury, and devastating destruction,\" King said in a statement Thursday night. \"We are meeting with the victims and their loved ones this evening to support them in navigating this unprecedented action and to ensure they are treated with fairness, dignity, and respect during this difficult time.\"MORE: Prosecutor seeks reduced sentence for truck driver who got 110 years for fatal crashShe said her office plans to share information it was prohibited from releasing while the case was pending.Among those advocating for a lesser sentence were the family members of some of those killed in the accident.\"I think we all can agree that [110 years] is excessive,\" Duane Bailey, the brother of William Bailey who died in the crash, told \"GMA,\" but added that the jury \"came to the correct decision to convict [Mederos].\"ABC News' Jeff Cook contributed to this report.Truck driver's sentence lowered to 10 years after originally receiving 110 years for fatal crash originally appeared on abcnews.go.comTRENDING 1.

The National Weather Service said a high wind warning was extended through 8 p.m. but winds were expected to lessen overnight. Snow that's expected Friday could also help douse the blaze, a National Weather Service meteorologist told USA TODAY.About 600 homes, a Target shopping complex and a hotel have been destroyed by fire in the area, according to Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle. One fire had burned over 1,600 acres in a suburban area as of Thursday evening, Pelle said at a press conference.There have been no reports of missing people or fatalities yet. But Pelle said he would not be surprised if there were injuries or fatalities resulting from the fires.Gov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon to allow the state to access emergency funds and services.\"This area, for those who don't know this area of Boulder County, is right in and around suburban sub-developments, stores \u2014 It's like the neighborhood that you live in,\" Polis said at the press conference. \"1,600 acres near a population center can be, and is in this case, absolutely devastating.\"On Thursday afternoon, a cloud of dark gray smoke could be seen blowing over the town of Superior, located about 20 miles northwest of Denver.Story continuesThe entire town, which has about 13,000 residents, was ordered to evacuate. About 210 homes were lost in the Old Town area of Superior.This news is developing into the evening. For an update later tonight, sign up for the Evening Briefing.PHOTOS: Wildfires near Denver force thousands to evacuate, vehicles and buildings burnedThe city of Louisville, Colorado, with some 20,000 residents, was also ordered to evacuate. All 370 homes in the Sagamore subdivision of Louisville also burned, Pelle said.In the old town area of Superior, Colorado, multiple buildings and vehicles are on fire, including an Element hotel.Six people were hospitalized with burns at UCHealth Broomfield Hospital, spokeswoman Kelli Christensen told USA TODAY. She could not elaborate on their conditions or the severity of burns due to HIPAA, a healthcare privacy law, but said all six were being treated currently.Centura-Avista Adventist Hospital, just northwest of Broomfield, evacuated its patients and employees as the flames grew closer. The hospital was fully evacuated by 4:15 p.m. and sent patients to two sister hospitals. Before the hospital was evacuated, videos posted to social media showed flames just across the street with homes on fire. One video showed hospital workers in a field outside the hospital with a hose nearby that had been used to wet the grass.\"Patients should not attempt to go to Avista Adventist Hospital; nearby roads have been closed. Patients should go to the nearest hospital to receive services or call 9-1-1 if it is emergency,\" said Lindsay Radford, a spokeswoman for the hospital.As of 5 p.m., the fire was hopscotching through several neighborhoods in Superior, setting ablaze some houses and leaving others untouched. Almost all that burned were completely unchecked, firefighters powerless to stop the flames being driven by the howling wind.Pat Kilbride, who has lived in the Old Town area of Superior for 30 years said his house burned down, killing his dog and cat. He said he believed many other homes were also destroyed.Kilbride rushed toward his house when he heard the fire was approaching the area, but couldn\u2019t get close because of road closures. By the time he arrived on foot, it was already engulfed.\u201cIt\u2019s all gone. The whole Old Town,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to head back to my truck and feel sorry for myself.\u201dBoulder County Office of Emergency Management has just announced an Evacuation Order for ALL of Superior, Colorado residents. Evacuation point is the South Boulder Recreation Center. The Superior Community Center is not an official evacuation location.\u2014 Town of Superior, Colorado (@townofsuperior) December 30, 2021Strong winds were helping fuel the blaze with gusts as strong as 115 mph measured earlier in the day just south of Boulder, Bruno Rodriguez, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service told USA TODAY. Constant winds were being measured around 40 mph with higher gusts throughout the region.Officials suspected some of the fires may have been sparked by downed power lines.Rodriguez said the winds were unlike anything they've seen this season. Coupled with six to seven months of incredibly dry conditions, he said, it was \"the worst, most terrible combination that just allowed a fast-moving fire like this.\"The region only saw about 1.6 inches of rain since August, which was \"well below normal,\" Rodriguez said.As firefighters continued to battle the raging fire, the area was also placed under a winter storm warning with several inches of snow forecast overnight and into Friday. The wet snow should help douse the blaze, along with winds forecasted to slow into the evening.\"We're going to thankfully see rapidly changing weather conditions,\" Rodriguez said. \"We've been waiting for this snow for a while, and it couldn't have come at a better time.\"Trevor Hughes reported from Boulder.

(Whitney Curtis/The New York Times)When she started her career in tech more than a decade ago, Shanae Chapman soon grew comfortable answering traditional interview questions: greatest strengths (time management, attention to detail), weaknesses (prioritization). \u201cTell me about yourself\u201d was kind of tricky, at first. No one in her family had ever held a corporate job before, and the question is actually weird. What exactly did the interviewer want to know? She figured it out quickly enough.Still, one question kept derailing her job search: What are you currently making? Chapman was earning about $25,000 a year working a desk job at a university in Boston while she was in graduate school. She hoped to double that figure by moving into a new industry. But when she told recruiters her salary, lo and behold they would tell her that\u2019s how much they were offering, too.A trap. \u201cWhy would I want to go to another job and make the same salary?\u201d said Chapman, now 34 years old and a senior user experience researcher and designer in St. Louis. She stopped answering the question, instead telling recruiters her target salary. The strategy worked. She landed a role at IBM that paid $50,000 to $60,000.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesSearching for a new job this past year during a booming job market, now with years of experience at large companies like IBM and Boeing and at startups, Chapman had a vastly different experience. Now employers aren\u2019t asking for her current salary. They\u2019re asking for her salary requirements: What does she want to make?\u201cAnd honestly, if they didn\u2019t ask \u2014 I would ask them,\u201d Chapman said. If they don\u2019t answer, she sees it as a red flag.The salary question has emerged as the thorniest piece of the hiring process, according to job seekers, recruiters and negotiation experts. The question itself is seen by some as progress \u2014 asking a requirement is better than asking salary history, and 16 states, including Massachusetts, New York and California, have completely banned asking job candidates their pay history \u2014 but it is still full of pitfalls.Story continuesAsking for salary requirements kicks off a back-and-forth that, for job seekers, is rife with confusion and occasional bouts of shame and regret. Even as employers are having trouble filling roles and employees across industries are asserting more power, the high stakes of this question can upend the process.Candidates try not to reveal their number, worried they\u2019ll leave money on the table. But recruiters often decline to move forward without one. The common advice is to turn around the question and ask recruiters what their range is for the role. In some states, employers are now required to tell you.Job seekers can say something like, \u201cIt\u2019s early in the interview process, and I\u2019m still getting to know the role and doing my research, but if you\u2019re trying to fit into a certain range, that would be helpful to know,\u201d said Jordan Sale, founder of 81cents, a pay equity startup she started in 2018.If the candidate has done research and has a sense of what the position should pay, Sale proposed, she could say: \u201cBased on all the research I\u2019ve done and conversations I\u2019ve had, I\u2019m thinking this role should probably pay $XX in terms of base salary plus bonus, equity and other benefits. I wonder if that lines up with what you\u2019re thinking.\u201dCandidates should answer the salary requirements question only if they\u2019ve done their research \u2014 otherwise, they are very likely to offer up a number that\u2019s too low. Plenty of candidates, particularly women, research shows, might end up undervaluing their worth.\u201cSome companies want to get away with not paying enough,\u201d said Sara Noble, an executive recruiter in Boston. She recommends that candidates stall when they\u2019re asked the requirements question and do serious research, maybe even call recruiters they\u2019ve spoken with in the past.\u201cI\u2019ve seen too many instances where the offer is well below what they were planning to pay,\u201d Noble said. \u201cYou\u2019ve shot yourself in the foot.\u201dIn the past, employers would typically just ask candidates for their current salary and base a new job offer on the number provided, maybe offering some small percentage more. Scholars and advocates for gender equality argue that this strategy perpetuates wage inequality. If a woman was paid unfairly at one employer, she would be anchored to that lower salary throughout her career.Banning the question, they argued, would help close the pay gap between men and women. On average, women earn 83 cents for every dollar a man makes, according to 2020 census data. The gap is wider for Black and Hispanic women.The argument resonated, and over the past five years, in addition to the states that passed salary history bans, a handful of cities and counties also prohibited the practice. Rhode Island and Nevada passed bans in 2021 that also require employers to disclose salary ranges to applicants. (Colorado and Connecticut recently passed laws requiring companies to disclose salary ranges for positions.)At a time when most policies aimed at helping parents, especially women \u2014 like paid parental leave and child care support \u2014 are stalling out or facing resistance, the bans on salary history have been far less controversial, often garnering bipartisan support, said Andrea Johnson, director of state policy for the Workplace Justice team and the National Women\u2019s Law Center, who has pushed for these laws.\u201cThis issue really resonates with people at a gut level,\u201d she said.The bans are still so new that it\u2019s hard to judge how much has changed. Massachusetts\u2019 law, the first in the country, went into effect in 2018. There is some preliminary research showing that pay for women who change jobs has increased slightly in states with the bans. But other research shows less promising results.\u201cBefore these laws were passed, women were underrepresented in high-wage jobs. That didn\u2019t change,\u201d said Ethan Rouen, a professor at Harvard Business School, who looked at data in one state that passed a ban and wound up not publishing his research because he didn\u2019t see any significant change.What is clear: The bans shifted the culture of salary negotiation, along with a growing willingness among Gen Z and millennials to talk more directly about money and demand better working conditions, and a job market where labor finally has a bit of an edge. Also, there is a growing awareness, especially among women, that negotiating pay is crucial.Several job hunters in their 20s and 30s said they had never been asked for their current salary.When it comes up, and it still does, it remains a tricky question. One 29-year-old New York woman said she still felt guilty for revealing her current salary to a recruiter who asked. She got nervous in the heat of the moment. When she said the number, in the low $100,000s, the recruiter said the company could match it. This woman felt instant regret. Maybe it would have gone higher? She said her parents had even scolded her for sharing her salary.Other candidates say that when this has happened to them, they respond by mentioning that the practice is no longer allowed.Hiring managers also said some people still volunteered their salary history. One lawyer, who is earning $280,000 a year at a fintech startup, tells prospective employers how much she makes because she doesn\u2019t want to get lowballed, she said. It\u2019s possible they would think she\u2019s reaching if she didn\u2019t anchor her salary requirements in a real number.Joel Greenberg, a 31-year-old software engineer, just started a new job at a startup after interviewing with about 20 companies. He recently moved back to the Denver area to care for his mother, after living in Boston.About half of the interviewers asked for Greenberg\u2019s current salary. He answered the question: About $250,000 a year, including a $155,000 base salary plus equity and other benefits. In other cases, he was asked for his requirements and offered up a similar number.\u201cI prefer to be direct about what I\u2019m making,\u201d Greenberg said, acknowledging that being a man probably made that easier. \u201cIt\u2019s part of straight white male privilege that you can answer that directly.\u201d In the end, he received six offers and accepted one that was in his range, although not the highest, because the fit was right.According to Sale, the consultant, the sort of privilege Greenberg is acknowledging goes beyond the confidence to answer a salary question directly. It extends to whom you know and whom you can ask for advice.Women will seek input from their close networks, which often might include a lot of women who are, on average, underpaid, she said.\u201cTalking about money is personal and sensitive, so we tend to talk about it with people we know well and are comfortable with,\u201d Sale said. \u201cFor most people \u2014 that means they\u2019re talking about pay with people who look like them.\u201dSale\u2019s company is one of a few startups founded to help candidates navigate this process. The idea is to offer people, particularly women of color, a network of senior professionals and data they can tap to navigate salary negotiation, Sale said.\u201cEmployers pay thousands of dollars every year to have access to compensation data,\u201d she said. The idea here is to level the playing field. \u201cLike an informal union,\u201d she said.Devon Meyer, a hiring manager at a mental health startup, does ask candidates for their salary requirements. He said about 20% won\u2019t answer.\u201cThey say, \u2018I\u2019m still calibrating\u2019 or \u2018I prefer not to share,\u2019 \u201d he said.He gets it. He also thinks they usually miss asking a more important question: What about equity?Meyer started his career at the tech company formerly known as Square and now called Block. He said that job had taught him a lesson about compensation. Specifically, stock can be more important than salary.\u201cEquity can turn out to be life-changing,\u201d said Meyer, 29, who had stock in Square when it went public. \u201cI do have a level of security that I certainly did not imagine I would have at this age.\u201d (Meyer was also briefly a senior product manager at The New York Times.)Meyer and others said candidates did not focus on their equity as closely as their base salary. A recent analysis commissioned by The Wall Street Journal found that 24% of male employees had company stock compared with 17% of women. And women typically hold fewer shares even when they do own stock.\u201cThe actual gender difference is in stock now,\u201d said Niya Dragova, co-founder of Candor, a startup that helps tech employees manage their equity but started off helping candidates negotiate pay more broadly.What looks like a small gap in stock will only grow wider. \u201cWhat might seem like a $10,000 difference could be millions over the course of somebody\u2019s career,\u201d Dragova said.Dragova is also the author of \u201cThe 10 commandments of salary negotiation.\u201dNo. 4: Don\u2019t give in to the pressure.That\u2019s one that Chapman, the user experience designer in St. Louis, seems to have followed. She declined to move forward in interviews with at least 28 employers, she said. (She kept track in a notes file on her laptop.) She was looking to move on from a role where she made $155,000 because she felt she had stalled out at the company and wanted to move into a leadership position.Chapman did market research, tapping salary surveys, to find out what companies were paying in her field. She talked to people in her professional network. She learned negotiation strategy from the National Society of Black Engineers and, early on, through the American Association of University Women, which offers a free negotiation workshop. One big lesson: It\u2019s OK to talk about money.Her target range was $160,000 to $170,000.\u201cIt was important to me to wait,\u201d said Chapman, who also founded a consulting company, Nerdy Diva, where she focuses on diversity and inclusion in tech, design and investing. \u201cI wanted to be strategic, and I wanted to go somewhere I knew I\u2019d be for the long term.\u201dAs the first in her family to get a college degree, Chapman felt her salary was about more than just herself. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me as a Black woman that I negotiate for what I\u2019m worth, and I\u2019m negotiating for the women in my family who did not have the opportunity,\u201d she said.Some companies tried to get her to take salaries she believed were too low because she was working remotely from the Midwest. But this wasn\u2019t only about money. In fact, she turned down a job offer for $170,000 because she didn\u2019t feel respected during the final-round interview. Interviewers were late, arrogant \u2014 a lot of name-dropping of big clients \u2014 and in the interview acknowledged they weren\u2019t actually prepared to talk to her.In December, she landed a job offer in her target range, at a place where she felt respected and noted a commitment to inclusion and diversity. She\u2019ll also get a stock package \u2014 around $200,000 vesting over four years. She starts at the end of January.\u00a9 2021 The New York Times CompanyOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

The last wave broke him.Annie GowenDecember 29, 2021, 9:46 AM\u00b712 min readROANOKE, Va. - Respiratory therapist Alva Daniels fought in covid hot spots throughout the pandemic, but it was only in recent months that the strain began to show.He started calling his wife from the hospital bathroom, crying, when he lost a patient. \"We can't save them. All we do is bag 'em and tag 'em,\" he told a friend. Then, as coronavirus cases fueled by the delta variant rose over the summer, he told his wife: \"Things are getting bad again and we don't have enough people to fight it. If something happens to me - if I die - I want to be buried next to my mom.\"Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. Alicia McAllister-Daniels, a nurse, thought her husband was talking about a breakthrough case of covid-19. Instead, Daniels, 38, died by suicide just five days later, his body found in a wooded area near the apartment in Fredericksburg where he was living while on a travel assignment.Related video: As COVID-19 patients fill ICU again, a doctor questions vaccine hesitancyAs the omicron variant threatens to bring a punishing fifth wave this winter, the country faces an unprecedented mental health crisis brought on by the nearly two-year pandemic. Hospitals and health-care facilities are woefully understaffed as capacity peaks once again - and workers, emotionally battered, burned out and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, are leaving the field in droves. Efforts to help them have taken on a new urgency, with Congress expected to pass landmark legislation in coming weeks aimed at reducing and preventing suicide and burnout and addressing the mental health needs of health-care workers.Alva was an easygoing guy who liked nothing better than strumming his guitar by a campfire. And he was used to working under pressure. Before the pandemic, he had worked on a transport team ferrying critically ill children. His death shocked his large community of family and friends in Roanoke and southwestern Virginia and left many - including his wife of less than a year - wondering if they could have done more, if there were warning signs they missed.Story continues\"I should be a newlywed,\" Alicia said. \"Now I'm a widow.\"Alicia McAllister-Daniels takes in the view from her office at Carilion Children's Hospital in Roanoke, where she works as a nurse, on Dec. 13. When she needed time off after the death of her husband, the hospital was very supportive.The elder Alva Daniels sits on the edge of the bed where his son used to sleep in the basement of his house in Jonesville, Va., starting at age 14 and later on visits home. On the wall are his son's graduation gowns from junior high, high school and college.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- - -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O ne day in early December, Alicia was in True Craft Tattoo in downtown Roanoke, talking with owner Jason Setchel about the design she wanted tattooed on her left arm to memorialize Alva.It was part of the grieving plan she'd created for herself in recent weeks, a way of getting through not just the first holiday without her husband, but also the cruel darkness of January and February to come. She managed a staff of 180 nurses and health-care workers at Carilion Children's Hospital in Roanoke, and now she turned her planning and organizational talents on herself: There would be a tattoo, or maybe tattoos, plural. Grief yoga. Reading notes from well-wishers she'd saved and not yet looked at.Alicia showed Setchel samples for her tattoo design: a song lyric to encircle her wrist that would incorporate a semicolon - a symbol of suicide prevention - and end with a loop (or maybe a star) on her radial artery, the point on the body where Alva had checked the blood oxygen levels of hundreds of patients over the years.If she could tolerate this one, she told Setchel, she'd come back for more.\"Part of my therapy plan is to get some tattoos and have somebody inflict physical pain on me so I'm not in emotional pain,\" she said.She had met Alva at the hospital over a decade ago when she was an intensive care nurse and he was a newly minted pediatric respiratory therapist who would later join the high-flying transport team. \"Nobody touches my kids unless they know what they're doing,\" she told him when they met. He just laughed.Later, when anybody asked what he'd been up to, he'd always say lightly, \"just saving babies.\"She was divorced and six years older, and neither was looking for anything serious. They spent time hiking, playing music and traveling to festivals in their 31-foot camper named Millie. They joked that if they were still together in 10 years they'd get married, \"and then we'd laugh and laugh and laugh,\" she recalled. The pandemic was raging on their 10-year dating anniversary in October 2020. They eloped to Asheville, N.C.In 2019, Alva took a new job as a traveling respiratory therapist, taking assignments at hospitals within driving distance of Roanoke, so he could go home on breaks. He ended up at Holston Valley Medical Center in Kingsport, Tenn., not far from the town in southwestern Virginia where he had grown up in a log home on the top of a mountain, and where his father, also named Alva, still lived.The elder Alva had been a lineman for coal companies, and his mother, Connie Gayle, was a nurse who taught him how to play the guitar. She was ill with her own respiratory issues when he left for college in 2001, and when she died a year later, \"he never forgave himself,\" his father said.Alva returned often to visit, finding the family mountain a place of solace - riding the tractor, walking the fields, devouring his stepmother's pinto beans and cornbread, and shooting targets with his handgun. \"This is where I am the happiest,\" he told Alicia during one visit, when they were curled up in his childhood bedroom, their Great Dane named Avett slumbering nearby.But last year's winter surge filled them both with dread, Alicia recalled. The loss of one covid patient in particular flattened him, she said. The man had loved watermelon, so Alva had searched all over town for the out-of-season fruit so the patient could taste it one more time before he was put on a ventilator. When he told Alicia about it, she said, \"Oh my God, babe, I'm glad it was you who was there with him.\"In January, Alva's primary care doctor prescribed the antidepressant Lexapro for him, but he was slower to seek professional help. His company did not provide counseling services for contract employees, an issue itself, and he feared - incorrectly - that he would cause Alicia problems at work if he sought help through her employee assistance program.Studies have shown that doctors and nurses were already almost twice as likely to die by suicide as people in other professions, even before the pandemic began. Its unrelenting barrage has put them more at risk, according to Corey Feist, president of the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation, a mental health advocacy group founded in honor of his sister-in-law, Lorna Breen, a New York doctor who died by suicide early in the pandemic. The foundation has worked with about a dozen families who have lost family members who work in health care to suicide in the past year, he said.\"Everyone is exhausted, there's not enough workforce to take care of patients, the doctors are tired, the nurses are tired and the cohort that is taking care of covid patients are exhibiting symptoms of PTSD, which puts them at risk of suicide, alcoholism and divorce,\" Feist said. \"It's like the military when you come back from war. This is 20-month tour of duty.\"Medical professionals like Breen often put off seeking help because of the stigma attached, Feist said, although some states are moving to change strict disclosure requirements on job applications. Around 62 percent of health-care workers have said that covid-19 has had a negative impact on their mental health, according to a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll from March, but only about 13 percent had received mental health services or medication because of that worry.Alva just kept saying he had to stay strong, said Peggy Meder, a nurse and longtime friend of the couple from Norfolk. He had come home in the summer when his Tennessee contract was up, saying he was taking a break. But he was restless, unable to sleep or calm down. He went out and bought a $60,000 Ram truck, his dream vehicle. Worried friends were surprised when he took a new contract at another hospital, this time in Fredericksburg.Meder ran into Alva in late July at a music festival in Floyd, Va., where he asked her if he could have a confidential talk. She led him to her campsite and the pair sat down on a couple of bean bag chairs, Alva grabbing her turquoise blue Fender guitar to play a few bars of the Old Crow Medicine Show song \"Wagon Wheel.\"Alva grew teary-eyed when he spoke of his work, Meder recalled.\"I don't know if I can do this. We're losing three to five people a shift,\" he told her. \"All we can do is bag 'em and tag 'em.\" The hospital was so short-staffed that the doctors had been doing after-death care of patients themselves, he said.Meder tried to comfort him, making him promise he'd see a counselor soon. They parted with a hug and a \"good cry,\" she said.About three weeks later, on Aug. 8, Alicia and Alva went to Washington for a Green Day concert at Nationals Park. They met up with friends, laughed and sang along with Billie Joe Armstrong under a cloudless summer night sky. But Alva grew contemplative in their hotel room afterward, Alicia recalled. He'd always said that if something happened to him he would never want to be on a ventilator more than two weeks. Now he was going a step further, telling Alicia he wanted to be buried next to his mom in the family plot in Kentucky's Harlan County, where he was born.She was vaguely alarmed, but thought he was talking about plans for what might happen if he died of covid-19. \"I clearly wasn't as concerned as I should have been,\" she said.The next day, they parted ways, with Alva heading to Fredericksburg to his new contract job and Alicia back to Roanoke. They planned to reunite the following weekend. On Aug. 12, the two said good night as usual, via text message.\"Sleep sweet,\" he told her, as he always did.Alicia awoke the next morning to a string of texts Alva had sent in the middle of the night, telling her it was too much and that he was going to end his life.Alva Daniels's grave lies in a small cemetery in Evarts, Ky. Alva told his wife that he wanted to be buried next to his mother, and because his death was so unexpected, he was buried in the plot that had been reserved for his father. The senior Alva will eventually be buried to the right of the main headstone.Alicia returns home after a walk with her Great Dane, Avett, on Dec. 11. She only recently began walking in her neighborhood again, as she had wanted to avoid engaging with people and being forced to talk about her new life as a widow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C andles flickered in Alicia's living room and meditation music emanated from the sound system as she went through yoga poses in her online grief therapy workshop one recent Saturday - phase two of her grieving plan. Outside, George, the cat, slept on one of the pair of rocking chairs on the porch of her home overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains. Inside, Avett, the Great Dane, was on the sofa with a watchful eye on her. Christmas lights glinted on a garland above, where she'd hung all the ornaments that reminded her of Alva - a tiny guitar, a miniature camper and a glittery helicopter that a family had given him one Christmas after he saved their daughter's life.The instructor's soothing voice reverberated from the computer propped on a pillow in front of her: \"I now invite you to move your body into the shape of your grief.\"\"I don't know how to do that,\" Alicia said to the dog. \"What do you think?\"She moved down on the mat in a kind of fetal squat, before fiddling with her wedding ring for a while and then giving up, collapsing into child's pose. Alva would have thought this was silly, she thought later, although he was always supportive when she used her yoga classes for stress relief.By now he'd been gone 17 weeks.Earlier, she had told the online group during introductions that she hoped to use the therapy sessions, which would stretch into January, to be \"intentional\" about how about how she was handling her feelings through the holiday season.\"I prefer my grief to be linear and it is not and that makes me angry,\" she told them.There's a baseline anger too - at Alva - that remains, but it's not as raw as it once was, she said after the session ended.\"I do think it will flare up, but it's more like sadness now - that he felt this was his only option,\" she said. \"It's something everyone should spend some time thinking about: What does it really mean when we say, 'Check on your people?' I'm a nurse, we're smart health-care professionals, and we were talking about therapy and all the things we should have been talking about and it still didn't help.\"She still had a few more steps of her grief project to go. She was going to finally sit down and read all the emails that friends had sent her recounting their favorite Alva stories. She also had the little smiley-face bowl her mother, Mina, had given her for her birthday in October. Her family had filled it with written messages of encouragement on folded scraps of paper. She was saving the bowl for the darkest part of winter. She planned to unwrap them slowly, savoring the messages one by one until spring comes.- - -\u00a0The Washington Post's Alice Crites and Emily Guskin contributed to this report.If you or anyone you know are having thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).Related ContentThis tree has stood here for 500 years.

So they all left without knowing that their friend they\u2019d spent countless hours swapping stories with never told them his biggest secret of all.For the past 50 years, he was a fugitive wanted in one of the largest bank robberies in Cleveland\u2019s history, living in Boston under a new name he created six months after the heist in the summer of 1969. Not even his wife or daughter knew until he told them in what authorities described as a deathbed confession.How he was able to leave behind one family and create a new life \u2014 while evading a father and son from the U.S. Marshals Service who never gave up their hunt \u2014 is just now being pieced together.\u00a0___Ted Conrad quickly figured out that security was fairly loose at the Society National Bank in Cleveland after he started as a teller in January 1969.He told his buddies, \u201cIt\u2019d be so easy for me to walk out with all kinds of money,\u201d Russell Metcalf, his best friend from high school, said in an interview with The Associated Press. They thought he was blowing smoke when he brought it up a few more times.Then just a day after his 20th birthday that July, Conrad walked out at closing time on a Friday with a paper bag stuffed with $215,000 from the vault, a haul worth $1.6 million today.\u00a0By the time the missing money was noticed the following Monday, Conrad was flying across the country. Letters sent to his girlfriend showed he made stops in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles within the first week.\u00a0Story continuesIn one letter, he mistakenly thought he could return in seven years when the statute of limitations expired. But once he was indicted, that was no longer true.Conrad apparently cut off contact with his entire family, including three siblings and his parents, who were divorced. Some family members eventually presumed he was dead because so many years had passed, said Matt Boettger, whose mother was Conrad's older sister.His mom, he said, was relieved more than anything to find out her brother had lived a happy life. \u201cShe thought she would go to her grave and never know,\u201d he said.___The bank heist in 1969 didn\u2019t capture the attention of the nation, or even the city of Cleveland. Everyone else was focused on Apollo 11\u2032s historic flight to the moon that week.But for John Elliott, a deputy U.S. marshal, it was personal. He and Conrad came from the same side of town. Elliott used to take his family to the ice cream shop where Conrad worked. They shared a doctor.\u00a0The problem was that Conrad's head start allowed him to disappear, and he was disciplined enough not to make any missteps. The last credible sighting came in October 1969, when a Cleveland couple visiting Hawaii met a man they later realized looked very much like Conrad.Elliott traveled across the U.S. looking for Conrad and even after retiring in 1990 he would come in the office just about every week and pour over the files, said his son, Pete Elliott, now the top U.S. marshal in Cleveland, who inherited the hunt for Conrad nearly 20 years ago.His father died in March 2020 before investigators pieced together details from Randele's obituary and signatures from his past. Then in November, Randele's family confirmed that just before he died he told them his real identity and what he had done, Elliott said.\u00a0\u201cIt always stayed on my dad\u2019s mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe kept this case going because it was important to my father.\u201d\u00a0___Why Conrad committed the robbery has been analyzed endlessly.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the money. He always wanted to impress people,\u201d said Metcalf, his high school pal, who remembered how Conrad once stole a deck of cards just to prove he could. \u201cHe had no fear.\u201dInvestigators believe he was inspired by the 1968 movie \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair,\u201d about a bank executive who got away with $2.6 million and turned the heist into a game.Conrad saw the film at least six times and copied Steve McQueen\u2019s character, driving sports cars and drinking high-end liquor, according to friends.After the real-life robbery in Cleveland, Conrad wound up in the Boston area, where much of the movie was filmed. It's a good possibility that he chose his new first name \u201cThomas\u201d based on the movie, Elliott said.\u201cHe modeled his whole life after the movie,\u201d he said.\u00a0___The man known as Thomas Randele came into existence the first week of January in 1970, investigators have found in recent weeks. That\u2019s when Conrad walked into a Social Security Administration office in Boston, asked for an identification number under his new name and made himself two years older, Elliott said.At that time, it wasn\u2019t unusual to wait until you were an adult, so his application didn\u2019t raise any red flags. With a new identification card, he was able to open a bank account, build credit and create his new life, Elliott said.\u00a0During the 1970s, Randele worked as an assistant golf pro, giving lessons at a country club outside Boston and later becoming its manager. He spent a few winters golfing in Florida, according to his obituary.He also met his future wife not long after arriving in Boston. They were married in 1982.Around then he began working in the car business, selling Land Rovers and Volvos at a handful of dealerships until he retired after nearly 40 years.It was a job that put him in front of dozens of strangers every day.\u00a0What\u2019s not clear yet is what happened to the money. The Marshals Service is looking into whether he lost it early on through bad investments.While Randele and his wife, Kathy, lived most of their years in a pleasant Boston suburb, they filed for bankruptcy protection in 2014. Court records showed they then owed $160,000 in credit card debt and had few assets.\u00a0His wife told Cleveland.com in November that her husband was a great man and that she was still grieving. She has declined interview requests.___No one would have guessed that Randele, who was 71 when he died, was someone trying to hide from authorities.Among the many people he became friends with over the years was an FBI agent in Boston, Elliott said.He never shied away from anyone on the golf course or in the auto showrooms where he'd keep a set of clubs and swing his 7-iron when sales were slow.\u00a0\u201cHe was just a gentle soul, you know, very polite, very well spoken,\u201d said Jerry Healy, who first met Randele at a Woburn, Massachusetts, dealership where they talked daily for years.\u00a0The two were among a group of five or six car salesmen who stuck together for much of their careers. None of them, Healy said, ever suspected something like this in Randele's past.\u00a0\u201cIt never dawned on us, and that\u2019s a half a dozen guys that aren\u2019t easy to fool,\u201d he said.\u00a0His former co-workers said they never heard Randele say a bad word about anybody or raise his voice. They all said he was the best golfer they ever knew. Everyone wanted him on their side when there was a tournament.He wasn't much of a drinker and never put down any side bets while playing, said Bob Van Wert, who first met Randele while golfing and then later worked with him.They remembered he could always control his emotions and rarely got upset, even on the course, where he had such a pretty swing that he once bested Hall of Fame golfer Johnny Miller at a charity event, his former boss remembered.Matt Kaplan, who managed two dealerships where Randele worked and golfed with him every Sunday morning for many years, called him the definition of a gentleman.\u201cThe only way it makes sense is that at that age he was just a kid, and it was a challenge kind of thing,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he became a professional bank robber.\"\"If he would have told us way back when, I don\u2019t think we would have believed him because he wasn\u2019t that kind of guy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man was different than the kid.\u201d___In the early days after Randele's identity was revealed, his friends couldn't believe it. But now looking back, there are a few things that make sense.\u00a0How he always had a beard. The photos of him wearing dark sunglasses on the golf course. His reluctance to talk about where he grew up or his extended family.\u00a0\u201cYou know all the years I knew Tommy, I never heard him mention a sister or a mother or a brother or a father. Everything was kind of generalized,\u201d Healy said.\u201cYou could never pry anything from him,\u201d said Brad Anthony, another close friend. \u201cI figured maybe he had a bad childhood and he didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\u00a0Still, he said it's almost impossible to believe. \u201cIt just seems so out of character for the Tom I knew,\u201d he said.All of his friends agreed that what happened long ago hasn't changed how they feel about him.\u201cThe man I knew didn\u2019t change all of a sudden because of something he did a lifetime ago,\u201d Healy said. \u201cHe was a good man, he was my friend and I think no less of him today than I did before this all came out. And I\u2019d love to go play a round of golf with him.\u201dOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

Family members are reportedly allowed to visit the men, and the \"seven-star\" housing units include gyms and offices.The Guardian reported that Salah al-Tubaigy, the forensic expert who dismembered Khashoggi, was seen inside the compound. Mustafa al-Madani, the man who posed as Khashoggi's body double, and Mansour Abahussein, the lead operative, were also spotted in sightings between 2019 and 2020.Over the last two years, witnesses saw caterers, family members, and gardeners visiting the men, the Guardian reported.Khashoggi, a prominent commentator and columnist for The Washington Post, was once within the Royal family's circle, but their opinion of him soured once his work became critical of the family's dealings.Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018 after he went to the consulate to pick up marital documents needed to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz.Turkish officials, along with UN and US officials, corroborated the allegations that Khashoggi's body was dismembered with a bone saw. His remains have yet to be found.In February, the Biden administration declassified a CIA intelligence report, which directly implicated the Saudi Crown Prince in Khashoggi's murder.\"We assess that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman (MBS) approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,\" said the report, provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Story continuesA UN report issued after Khashoggi's killing seconded the claim, saying that \"Assessments of the recordings by intelligence officers in Turkey and other countries suggest that Mr. Khashoggi could have been injected with a sedative and then suffocated using a plastic bag.\"A Turkish court is currently trying 26 Saudi nationals connected to the murder in absentia, with the next trial date set for July 8.The Saudi government, after a series of excuses, admitted that Khashoggi was killed in a \"rogue operation,\" and placed 11 individuals on trial. Five people were sentenced to death in December 2019 by the Riyadh Criminal Court for \"committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim\" while three others were handed prison sentences.The Guardian reported all of the men spotted in the complex were tried and sentenced as part of the trial, which was heavily criticized around the globe. Ahmad Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, two high-ranking officials close to MBS, scraped by with no charges.After the ruling, Cengiz said, \"The ruling handed down today in Saudi Arabia again makes a complete mockery of justice.\"Khashoggi's murder ignited a global pressure campaign against the Saudi regime, prompting officials in the US and abroad to briefly question their diplomatic relationships with Saudi Arabia.After President Biden's first meeting with MBS in early March, he reportedly refused to sanction the Saudi regime over Khashoggi's killing.Read the original article on Business InsiderOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

One said he should be \u201cquaking in his boots\u201d.The Duke, who denies the claims, hopes that a judge will throw out a civil case being brought against him by Virginia Roberts Giuffre at a hearing scheduled for January 4.Attempts to paint her as an unreliable witness, however, have been dealt a blow after Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking underage girls for paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison in 2019. Both Epstein and Maxwell were friends of the Duke.A sketch of Ghislaine Maxwell in court as her guilty verdicts were delivered. She is due to be sentenced at a later date - Reuters/Jane RosenbergNot only did a New York court decide that four other victims were telling the truth, but one of Maxwell\u2019s convictions included a reference to Ms Giuffre.Sigrid McCawley, who represents Ms Giuffre and Maxwell victim Annie Farmer, told The Telegraph: \u201cThis verdict told the American public that regardless of power, or privilege, whether you\u2019re a president or a prince, you will be held accountable.\u201cWhat we saw at the trial is a mention of Prince Andrew and people of his stature. The jury looked at Ghislaine, who has summered at the Queen\u2019s homes and lived a life of incredible privilege associating with those types of people, and yet they disregarded all that. I see a real change in the legal landscape.\u201dMs Giuffre is seeking unspecified damages, claiming the Duke assaulted or raped her on three separate occasions in 2001 when she was 17. The Duke denies her claims and says he has no recollection of meeting her.After Maxwell was found guilty of five of the six counts she faced, Ms Giuffre, now 38, said: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not over.\u201dPressure on the Duke intensifiesThe Duke of York pictured with Virginia Roberts Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001The scandal has dogged Prince Andrew for more than a decade, ever since Ms Giuffre\u2019s allegations, and the photograph of her with the Duke and Maxwell, were made public.Story continuesThe accusations have caused great embarrassment to the Royal family and saw the Duke step down from public duties before Ms Giuffre\u2019s civil suit was launched in New York in August.Ian Maxwell, Ghislaine\u2019s brother, told The Telegraph on Thursday that his family planned to appeal her guilty verdict on the grounds she was \u201cdenied\u201d a fair trial.\u201cThis is a shocking result which reflects the fact that Ghislaine has been denied the right to a fair trial, starting with the appalling conditions in which she has been held for over 18 months and which seriously impacted her ability to participate in her own defence,\u201d he said.Lawyers for the victims said Maxwell, 60, should not be the last defendant brought before a jury over the Epstein scandal, amid speculation that other high-profile associates whose names were found in his so-called \u201clittle black book\u201d might now face questions.While Ms Giuffre was not a witness in Maxwell\u2019s trial, she loomed large over proceedings, with almost 250 mentions of her and multiple photographs shown to the jury.Legal experts also noted that the required burden of proof in a criminal trial was higher than in a civil case.Bradley Simon, a former federal prosecutor who now works as a defence attorney in New York, said: \u201cEvery case rests on its own facts. The jury verdict, however, will surely embolden the Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys in the case against Prince Andrew.\u201dDuke\u2019s technical objections \u2018aren\u2019t going to fly\u2019Virginia Roberts Giuffre with a photo of herself at age 16, when she says Jeffrey Epstein began abusing her sexually - Emily Michot/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty ImagesThe comments from Ms Giuffre\u2019s lawyer heap pressure on the FBI to re-examine the claims against the Duke.Federal prosecutors in New York formally requested through the British Government to speak with the Duke last year as part of their criminal investigations into both Epstein and Maxwell. The Duke\u2019s lawyers responded by saying that they offered his help as a witness on at least three occasions in 2020.Despite his long and close friendship with Maxwell, the Duke is understood to have been reassured by his UK-based team that the guilty verdict will make \u201cno difference\u201d to his own case and has nothing to do with him.Andrew Brettler, the Duke\u2019s lead counsel, has asked Lewis Kaplan, the judge, to halt proceedings on the basis that Ms Giuffre lives in Australia and not Colorado, as her lawsuit suggests, which would invalidate her claim under federal court law.However, a source close to Ms Giuffre insisted that her team was well aware of her living arrangements, branding it \u201cpretty desperate stuff\u201d that showed a \u201clack of confidence\u201d in their other arguments.Lisa Bloom, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who represented eight of Epstein\u2019s victims, said that in the wake of Maxwell\u2019s conviction, the Duke\u2019s technical objections \u201caren\u2019t going to fly\u201d.She added: \u201cHe should be quaking in his boots because this shows that a jury is willing to come back with a guilty verdict even if the accusers are not perfect, as no human being is.\u201d\u2018If Ghislaine flips, she\u2019ll flip now\u2019The picture of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at the Queen\u2019s log cabin in Balmoral is thought to have been taken in 1999 - US Department of Justice/PAScotland Yard confirmed that it was still liaising with prosecutors in the US regarding the Epstein investigation, but was not currently taking any action.Meanwhile, a former Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutor told The Telegraph that Maxwell had a limited time to decide if she wanted to \u201cflip\u201d on other former associates of Epstein.If she wants to receive a reduced sentence, she will have to reach out to SDNY prosecutors before they submit a report to the judge ahead of the sentencing.The former prosecutor, who asked that his name not be published, said it was likely his former colleagues would look favourably on such a request if she has any information on other individuals.He said: \u201cCertainly, she could still flip. That\u2019ll help with regards to the sentence. It\u2019s still possible. If she flips, she\u2019ll flip now.\u201cWith a guilty verdict, the best way to help herself is to co-operate. It would benefit the prosecution and it benefits her prior to sentencing because they put it in the sentencing report. It\u2019s a point system.\u201dEpstein and Maxwell\u2019s little black book was admitted in evidence during the trial and contains the names of some 300 Britons.There are 16 separate telephone numbers for the Duke, including a mobile phone number, one marked \u201cPalace ex-directory\u201d, one for Balmoral \u2013 the Queen\u2019s private retreat in Scotland, where the Duke invited Epstein \u2013 and one marked \u201cSand\u201d, which appears to be Sandringham, the other royal retreat where he spent time.Tony Blair, the former prime minister, is recorded once, while Lord Mandelson of Foy has 10 numbers, including one marked \u201cdirect line\u201d, one marked \u201chome\u201d and one marked \u201ccountry home\u201d.Earl Spencer, the brother of Diana, Princess of Wales, also features.There is no suggestion that those named were involved in any wrongdoing.Maxwell faces up to 65 years behind bars on the sex trafficking charges and four others.

In May, Dershowitz said he was suing Netflix for $80m over his portrayal in its Filthy Rich series about Epstein in which they aired Giuffre's allegations.

Bush43rd president of the United StatesRon JohnsonAmerican politicianErin BurnettNews anchorOn CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Out Front Tuesday, fill-in host Poppy Harlow spoke with CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner about all things COVID-19, and got his reaction to comments made by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) on Fox News during their Monday primetime block, regarding the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines.\u201cWe all hoped and prayed the vaccines would be 100 percent effective, 100 percent safe. But they\u2019re not,\u201d Johnson said on Monday. \u201cWe now know that fully vaccinated individuals can catch COVID, they can transmit COVID. So what\u2019s the point?\u201dAfter playing a clip of Johnson\u2019s interview, Harlow asked Reiner, who advised the White House medical team under President George W. Bush, what he thought of those comments.\u201cI\u2019d say that he\u2019s so misguided that it makes me wonder whether this is all just an act. And if it is an act, what does that say about what he thinks his constituents want to hear?\u201d Reiner said, later adding. \u201cAnd if this is not an act, then he is just the most ignorant man in the United States Senate. And that says a lot.\u201dJohnson has been making headlines with what some have considered to be outrageous claims throughout the course of the pandemic, causing many health experts to label him as one of the main perpetrators of misinformation happening in our country. And that\u2019s something that Reiner says has consequences.\u201cHis propagation of this nonsense that somehow vaccines don\u2019t work and are unsafe is the reason why so many of his constituents are becoming hospitalized and are dying,\u201d Reiner said.Erin Burnett Out Front\u00a0airs weeknights at 7 p.m. on CNN.Watch what Dr. Fauci had to say about possible vaccine mandates for domestic air travel:Tell us what you think!

Ron DeSantis to do more to address the state's spike in infections driven by the highly-transmissible omicron variant.The state on Wednesday reported 46,923 new cases from Tuesday, as the omicron surge nearly doubled Florida's previous peak over the summer. The state, which broke the record for new daily infections that was just set on Christmas Eve, is now averaging more than 30,300 new covid-19 cases a day, according to data tracked by The Washington Post - second in the nation to New York.Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. While deaths continue to decline in Florida - an average of 18 a day as of Wednesday - the number of cases has exploded by 182% compared to the previous seven-day period. Florida now has reported 4 million total cases since the pandemic began, joining California and Texas as the only states with at least 4 million coronavirus infections since 2020.Related video: DeSantis warns against 'Faucian dystopia'Amid the surge, some in the state have argued that DeSantis, who recently signed multiple bills into law to curtail vaccine and mask mandates, has not done enough to help against omicron. Orange County, Fla., Mayor Jerry Demings, a Democrat, claimed at a news conference this week that counties have yet to receive funding for increased coronavirus testing during the holidays. He also questioned why DeSantis has been largely absent during the state's record-breaking period.\"We have not received any assistance from the state of Florida at our testing sites,\" he said on Tuesday. \"Our residents, all Florida residents, should be outraged and they should ask the question, 'Where is our state? Where is our governor? Where is Ron DeSantis now?'\"Story continuesDeSantis, one of the most prominent Republican critics of President Joe Biden's handling of the pandemic, has not made a public appearance since a Dec. 17 news conference, according to Florida Politics. DeSantis also appeared on Fox News on Dec. 19, saying that he had yet to receive a coronavirus booster shot.\"I've done whatever I did, the normal shot, and that at the end of the day is people's individual decisions about what they want to do,\" the governor told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo at the time.Christina Pushaw, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, told The Washington Post on Thursday that omicron is responsible for most of the new cases in Florida, adding that many of the new infections appear to be \"asymptomatic or mild.\" She noted how states such as California and New York are also breaking records for new infections, saying it is \"evident that the vaccine passports, mask mandates and other heavy-handed government interventions did not achieve their stated goals.\"\"In Florida, we are continuing to emphasize the importance of early treatment and doing everything possible to expand access to clinically effective treatments,\" Pushaw said in a statement. \"Governor DeSantis is not imposing any mandates or lockdown policies that have already proven ineffective in other parts of the country.\"More than 4,400 people in Florida are hospitalized with covid, including 498 in the intensive care unit. While the hospitalization rate has increased by more than 100% compared to last week, Pushaw argued that \"the percentage of cases requiring hospitalization as of now is lower overall than we saw with previous variants.\"The spike in Florida comes as coronavirus cases are soaring nationwide, with the nation averaging about 240,000 new infections a day. Ahead of New Year's Eve, Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, has urged Americans to rethink any potential party plans and encouraged smaller gatherings to help prevent the spread of the virus.Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Wednesday that hospitalizations remain \"comparatively low,\" noting that those totals tend to lag behind infections by roughly two weeks. But she emphasized that omicron appears to cause milder symptoms, especially for vaccinated people.In Florida, 63% of the population is vaccinated, which is slightly above the national rate of 62%.Since DeSantis's last appearances, cases have skyrocketed in Florida and across the country thanks to omicron, which is now the nation's dominant variant.The recent focus from the DeSantis administration has been on the U.S. government's pause on distributing monoclonal antibodies that have been used as treatment for many coronavirus patients who have not been vaccinated. Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo recently accused the Biden administration of \"actively preventing\" the distribution of the monoclonal antibody treatments from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly. The government noted that the treatments were unlikely to be effective against omicron.In a Tuesday letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Ladapo wrote that the pause from the administration would cause an \"immediate and life-threatening shortage of treatment options.\" DeSantis has touted monoclonal antibody treatments, specifically Regeneron, as an effective way to keep people out of the hospital.Many of the new cases are coming from South Florida, where the state's three most populous counties - Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach - have seen their case totals increase by close to 400% in recent days, according to the Miami Herald. Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist with the University of South Florida, told WPTV that omicron outpacing the delta variant could be cause for concern for the state's hospitals. It took more than a month for delta to average 21,000 daily cases.\"For omicron, that's happened in 12 days,\" Salemi said.Pushaw said that the Jackson Health System in Miami reported Thursday that more than half of its patients who tested positive for the virus were \"incidental positives\" - \"people who were admitted to the hospital for other reasons (not covid-19 symptoms) and incidentally tested positive upon admission.\"More than 776,000 new coronavirus tests have been administered in Florida over the past seven days, the second-highest total in the nation, according to data tracked by The Post. Twenty-two percent of those who've tested were positive. Raul Pino, director of Florida Department of Health in Orange County, acknowledged the lack of resources for even more testing in the area. Not even adding more testing sites could prevent the department from being overwhelmed, he told the Associated Press.\"A lot of people are wanting to get tested,\" he said.Some on social media documented the long lines for in-person testing in the state. A video posted to Twitter by Brian Entin, a journalist with NewsNation Now, showed the miles-long line of cars waiting to enter Miami-Dade County's 24-hour testing site on Wednesday night.\"This is the wait before you even get into Tropical Park where you have to zig zag around cones before the testing area,\" he tweeted.Democrats and critics were quick to accuse DeSantis of being \"MIA.\" Democratic State Sen. Annette Taddeo, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2022, shared a message she purportedly received from a friend about a difficult situation at a hospital in her district.\"And where's Ron DeSantis?\" she tweeted.On MSNBC, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, who is also running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, was asked by host Tiffany Cross on Wednesday if she knew why DeSantis had not made a public appearance during the holiday surge.\"I have no idea ... I haven't seen him since December 17,\" Fried said. \"I don't know where he is.\"On Thursday, as DeSantis's name trended on Twitter, Pushaw tweeted that the governor \"has a wife and 3 kids ages 1-5, and it's not surprising if he wants to take a few days off at Christmas to spend time with his family, especially as his wife is battling cancer.\"\"I don't criticize Biden for going to Rehoboth Beach all week, right?\" she wrote.Related ContentThis tree has stood here for 500 years.

Hospitalisations are at their highest rate since mid-September, when the wave driven by the Delta variant was ebbing away, and cases are now rising at their fastest pace since the summer.Mr DeSantis\u2019s turn away from regular public appearances to discuss the pandemic has drawn fire from state officials, including Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, who said this week that Florida residents \u201cshould be outraged\u201d and \u201cshould ask the question, \u2018Where is our state? Where is our governor? Where is Ron DeSantis now?\u2019 When is the last time you saw the governor do a press briefing on Covid-19?\u201dThe governor\u2019s office has been contacted for comment.While he has insisted he does not intend to run for president in 2024 and is instead focusing on re-election, the governor is polling well in fields of potential non-Trump candidates \u2013 partly thanks to his staunch opposition to many of the anti-Covid measures promoted and imposed by the federal government.Mr DeSantis has this year steadily ramped up his opposition to masking requirements and in particular vaccine mandates, at one point selling merchandise via his campaign site emblazoned with the slogan \u201cDon\u2019t Fauci My Florida\u201d. The state recently passed laws that limit private employers\u2019 ability to require employees get vaccinated, leading major companies including Disney to pause their existing policies for fear of legal problems.Mr DeSantis has lately focused on promoting monoclonal antibody treatments, again putting him at odds with the Biden administration as authorities examine whether the drugs are in question are in fact effective against the Delta and Omicron variants.Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

Ron DeSantis has been missing in action as Covid cases in the state have spiked to new heights, Florida Democratic officials charge.\"Counties are overwhelmed w/ lines that stretch for miles,\" state Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat, tweeted Thursday. \"It's every man/woman for themselves, because leadership is MIA,\" he added.DeSantis, a Republican and outspoken opponent of vaccine and mask mandates, last held a Covid press briefing on Dec. 17. Covid cases have reached new highs in Florida since then, including a record level of more than 58,000 new cases on Wednesday.DeSantis' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. His press secretary, Christina Pushaw, tweeted Thursday that the governor has \"a wife and 3 kids ages 1-5, and it\u2019s not surprising if he wants to take a few days off at Christmas to spend time with his family, especially as his wife is battling cancer. I don\u2019t criticize (President Joe) Biden for going to Rehoboth Beach all week, right?\"Pushaw pointed out some of his daily schedule from Tuesday, which showed he had had meetings scheduled at the Florida Capitol with state officials.In a press conference Tuesday, Jerry Demings, the Democratic mayor of Orange County, called on the governor to step up his response efforts because the omicron surge has resulted in people waiting in line as long as five hours to get tested.\"We have not received any assistance from the state of Florida at our testing sites,\" Demings said. \"Local governments have been left to figure it out and respond on our own. We are doing our best.\"\u201cHe signed into law legislation that effectively prohibited local governments from being able to take charge and lead in our fight against Covid-19,\u201d Demings said.\"Our residents, all Florida residents should be outraged, and they should ask the question, now, where's our state? Where's our governor? Where is Ron DeSantis now? When was the last time you saw the governor do a press briefing regarding Covid-19?\" Demings asked.Story continuesFollowing Demings' complaints, DeSantis's Twitter account tweeted a picture of him at a sweet shop in Chipley. DeSantis's office told MSNBC the sweet shop visit actually took place on Dec. 16.The state's agriculture commissioner, Nikki Fried, said Wednesday that she had \"no idea\" where DeSantis was.Fried, who's running for governor as a Democrat, told MSNBC that DeSantis \"cancelled our Cabinet meeting in the middle of December\" and \"I haven't seen him since Dec. 17. I don't know where he is.\"\"Local counties and state commissioners are having to stand up testing sites,\" she said. \"We have five hour lines in Miami-Dade county, and he's nowhere to be found.\"In her Twitter feed, Pushaw blamed the White House for the long testing lines. \"Regarding tests, ask Biden, who is on vacation,\" she tweeted.Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

Attempts to reach Jones for comment this week were unsuccessful, and his attorney, Leslie Wilcox, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Valentina Orellana-Peralta and her mom, who had recently moved to the U.S. from Chile, were in a changing room when cops stormed a Burlington Coat Factory in North Hollywood on Dec. 23 to confront a man who was swinging a bike lock at women, bloodying at least one of them. That cops opened fire in spite of the suspect not being armed with a gun quickly served to revive long-standing tensions between the LAPD and communities of color, as well as the debate over police use of force nationally.Surveillance footage and body-cam video released by the LAPD shows one officer firing three shots from a rifle in the direction of suspect Daniel Elena-Lopez, 24. Elena-Lopez was killed, but a bullet also penetrated a dry wall, piercing Valentina in her chest.Soledad Peralta said at a Tuesday press conference that her daughter locked the changing room door as the chaos unfolded \u201cto try to protect us,\u201d and that the pair hugged and prayed until they \u201cfelt an explosion that threw us both to the ground.\u201d Peralta looked down to see her daughter convulsing, with white powder coming out of her body. \u201cShe died in my arms, and there was nothing I could do,\u201d she said.Mom Says LAPD Left Teen Daughter to Die After Horrific Clothing Store ShootingSocial media accounts, now either locked or removed, and past interviews reveal that prior to the disastrous incident, Jones was determined to position himself as a bridge between police and communities of color.Story continues\u201cI\u2019m a black man, I\u2019m the father of a black son, I\u2019ve been the vict[im] of racism,\u201d he wrote in one now-removed tweet. \u201cI\u2019m the LAPD. I have the power & determination to affect CHANGE in the community. Im a proud member of the #thinblueline & #blacklivesmatter.\u201dCached posts on his vanished Twitter page show him promoting a nonprofit, Officers for Change, and related charitable activities, while another now-inaccessible account indicates he coached a local high-school football team.He appears to have closed Officers for Change\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts, and substantially dismantled its website. But archived material shows it plugged itself as \u201ca 501(c)(3) nonprofit org. on a mission to positively impact the lives of those living in At-Risk & Low Income communities\u201d with a \u201cSworn platform to Educate, Inspire, Mentor & Motivate.\"The Kentucky native spoke of his experiences and interests in a now-deleted December 2020 article on the website of his alma mater, the University of Louisville. \u201cBeing an African American police officer and from Louisville has given me a very unique perspective,\u201d he said.The article reported that Jones moved to L.A. in 2006 to pursue a career in entertainment but instead became a cop, spending eight years on patrol and then three years as a community relations officer.Public records also suggest he may have sought additional avenues to profit off his policing career: Business, trademark, and website information The Daily Beast uncovered show Jones launched an athletic apparel line in 2019 called \u201cUse of Force Fitness.\u201dIn recent days, Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Bonin led a chorus of residents and activists calling the LAPD\u2019s use of force in the deadly incident unjustified.\u201cPolice gave no verbal command and didn\u2019t try to to [sic] de-escalate. The suspect didn\u2019t have a gun and wasn\u2019t advancing at officers or potential victims. Police opened fire in a shopping mall with people in it,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Bystanders who called 911 about Elena-Lopez offered contradictory information. One caller incorrectly said he was armed with a gun and had fired shots.Tom Saggau, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing Jones, said officers went in expecting an active-shooter situation.\u201cYou\u2019re trained to enter the facility and try to eliminate the threat so that more people aren\u2019t shot. That\u2019s the mindset as they\u2019re responding to that call,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.He said Jones was \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d by the outcome.However, Valentina\u2019s family, which is being represented by high-profile civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, demanded accountability on Tuesday, and claimed officers left Valentina to die alone on the floor as they evacuated others from the store.In a statement Monday, LAPD Chief Michel R. Moore said he was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d for her death and promised a \u201cthorough, complete and transparent investigation.\u201d The California Attorney General\u2019s Office and California Department of Justice also launched separate probes.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

He has worked at the department for about a dozen years, according to a profile published last year by the University of Louisville, his alma mater.The LAPD released an edited video package online Monday that included 911 calls, police radio transmissions, body camera footage and surveillance video from the Dec. 23 shooting. The array of footage showed the suspect's erratic movements in the store, his attacks on multiple customers and the moment Jones fired his weapon. The 911 calls show police received conflicting information, first being told the suspect was assaulting people with a bicycle lock then later that the suspect might be armed and was shooting inside the store.Soledad Peralta and Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas, the parents of Valentina Orellana-Peralta, attend a news conference outside Los Angeles Police Department headquarters on Tuesday.In the footage, police officers \u2013 including Jones \u2013 didn't give any commands to the suspect, who was shot down the aisle from a bloodied assault victim. He could be seen holding the metal bike lock, which he used in the assault, and a piece of artwork when he was shot. No firearms were found.The LAPD said one of Jones' bullets pierced a wall behind the suspect and hit Valentina Orellana-Peralta, 14, who was in a dressing room with her mother trying on dresses for Christmas. Valentina dropped to the ground, started convulsing and died in her mother's arms.\"I tried to wake her up by shaking her, but she didn't wake up,\" the teen's mother, Soledad Peralta, said in a statement read at a news conference this week.'HEART HAS BEEN RIPPED OUT': Mom of teen killed by LA cop in Burlington store prayed, held daughter as she diedStory continuesValentina Orellana-PeraltaThe footage released by police shows Jones was told to \"slow down\" more than a dozen times by other responding officers before shots were fired. He has been placed on administrative leave, the department confirmed to USA TODAY.Tom Saggau, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents LAPD officers, told USA TODAY that Jones had been a model officer before the shooting.Jones launched a non-profit with his wife, called Officers For Change, that aimed to help children in low-income households, he said. The charity collected and solicited donations primarily from other officers, allowing them to hand out school supplies and backpacks ahead of the school year, Saggau said. In his spare time, Jones also helped coach a football team, he added.\"There wouldn't be a department in the country who wouldn't want him as a police officer,\" Saggau said. \"This was horrendous and tragic. But this wasn't an officer with an obvious character flaw or something.\"NEWS AT NIGHT: Sign up for USA TODAY's free Evening Briefing newsletterJones grew up in Kentucky and moved to Los Angeles in 2006 to pursue work in the entertainment industry, according to the profile published online by the University of Louisville.He became interested in police work while out West and finished his communications degree online while working with LAPD, the profile says. The story, published in December 2020, notes he \"spent eight years on patrol and the past three years working as a community relations officer.\"Police yellow tape blocks the scene where two people were struck by gunfire at a Burlington store in North Hollywood, Calif., on Dec. 23.Saggau said inaccurate reports of an active shooter likely fueled a mindset that officers needed to quickly stop the threat to prevent death. In those situations, he said, officers prepare for the worst-case scenario, which is why Jones came prepared with a long rifle, instead of a less-lethal weapon.Since the shooting in 1999 at Columbine High School in Colorado, police departments across the country have changed procedures and protocols on responding to active shooters. Instead of securing an area and waiting for backup, law enforcement officers have been trained to engage immediately on the scene.A bulletin sent in 2003 to all Los Angeles police officers, which LAPD confirmed to USA TODAY is still in effect, defined an active shooter as someone armed \"who has used deadly force on other persons and aggressively continues to do so while having unrestricted access to additional victims.\"Flowers and balloons are left at a makeshift memorial on Monday for the teenage girl who was killed by a stray police bullet at a Burlington store in North Hollywood, California.While the suspect, identified by police as Daniel Elena Lopez, 24, wasn't armed with a gun, officers can be heard in released police footage saying he was in the midst of attacking a woman in the seconds before they approached.The bulletin noted officers have to \"assess the situation objectively, evaluate their options and act accordingly.\" It notes a variety of dangerous situations, from suspects who are actively shooting to those who have hostages, and says misunderstandings of the term active shooter had caused \"a premature response\" with rapid deployment tactics used in an active shooter situation.An active shooter presentation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which has jurisdiction for a large area surrounding the city, notes the primary goal when law enforcement officers contact a suspect is to \"stop suspect's deadly behavior\" and \"take the suspect into custody\" with the least amount of force necessary. Officers should \"give clear and concise orders to the suspect.\"On why Jones did not yell any commands to the suspect, including to drop any weapons or to come out with his hands up, Saggau said that will be a focus of investigators.\"None of us know what was going through that officer's mind,\" he said. \"I would never dare put myself in the position of those officers. They'll be plenty of investigations and questions, but what the public should do is try to put themselves in the shoes of that officer in that moment.\"Contributing: Mary Ramsey, Louisville Courier JournalThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Los Angeles police ID cop who killed teen girl in Burlington shootingOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

Here's what happens when you stop drinking alcohol for 30 days for Dry January, according to experts. (Photo: Getty)No in the New Year is Yahoo Life\u2019s series about the power of saying no, establishing boundaries and prioritizing your own physical and mental health.For some people who imbibe, the champagne toast at midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve is the last drop of alcohol they typically touch for the next month. That\u2019s the official start of Dry January, an initiative that was originally started in 2012 by Alcohol Change UK in order to get people to see the mental, physical, and even financial benefits of living without alcohol.Yet most people who participate in Dry January have no intention of quitting alcohol for good \u2014 completing the month-long break is the goal. However, if the point of Dry January is to feel better and be overall healthier, is 30 days (or in January's case, 31) even enough?Unfortunately, the experts Yahoo Life spoke with all agreed that 30 days isn\u2019t enough time to reset your body after years of drinking regularly. However, there may be other surprising benefits of trying out sobriety in the short term.According to Dr. George F. Koob, the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, participating in Dry January can be a great way to learn more about your drinking habits, which can help you make healthier choices moving forward.\u201cThere are many potential benefits to taking a break from alcohol if done wisely,\u201d Koob tells Yahoo Life. \u201cAt the very least, taking a break from alcohol gives a person a chance to evaluate their relationship with alcohol and cultivate alternatives for relaxing, socializing, coping and other reasons why people drink.\"It can also shed light on how drinking alcohol affects your physical and mental health. \"Some people might discover that their alcohol use was irritating their stomach, disrupting their sleep, contributing to weight gain, interfering with their morning exercise routine, affecting their relationships, or that they relied more on alcohol for stress relief than they thought,\" says Koob. \"Waking up without the fatigue, malaise and other common symptoms of hangovers could potentially improve a person\u2019s quality of life. And for some people the financial savings could be substantial.\u201dStory continuesIn terms of purely the physical results of Dry January, heavy drinkers may find they see the biggest change, Dr. Tyler Oesterle, medical director of the Mayo Clinic Health System\u2019s Foundation Centers, tells Yahoo Life. \u201cAlcohol is toxic to a lot of organ systems in the body,\" Oesterle says. \"It can affect the liver, pancreas, heart and the nervous system, just to name a few. One month of abstinence, if any of these organ systems are compromised, could improve acute symptoms. For example, if individuals are heavy drinkers and have suffered some liver damage, then abnormalities in their liver enzymes can improve over the first 30 days.\"Oesterle adds: \"There may also be other improvements for heavy drinkers in the first 30 days depending on the physical impact of their alcohol use. If an individual is a light drinker, the one month abstinence can be used to establish a new abstinence-based habit. However, it is not really enough time to make any significant difference physically for light drinkers.\u201dClick and scroll in the window below to explore the body after 30 days without alcohol.For more immersive stories click here.Elective sobriety coach Amanda Kuda agrees that, while 30 days may not be enough time to make any meaningful physical changes, it can be a great start for someone who is sober curious. For those who might worry about the stigma of giving up alcohol, Dry January offers a built-in excuse to be sober, especially after what is most likely the \u201cmost intense drinking period of the year,\u201d she says.Kuda explains that \u201cDry January is a socially acceptable way to take a step back from alcohol, in a world that\u2019s obsessed with booze. If you live in a place where alcohol is something you\u2019re expected to participate in, Dry January is a perfect opportunity for you to take a step back without anyone questioning your motives. It offers you the opportunity to take a step back and say, \u2018Is this something I want to explore further?\u2019 I see 30 days as a great catapult to a longer term change, as well as a short-term break for your body.\u201dWhile she notes that people who believe they may have an alcohol dependency should consult with a medical professional before going cold turkey, even for 30 days, overall Kuda thinks Dry January can be \u201ca great opportunity to be observant about our behavior around alcohol.\u201d It might even encourage you to continue the sober experiment past January 31.\u201cAnyone can do anything for 30 days,\u201d Kuda says, \u201cbut that real change in your relationship with alcohol is when you can extend it and see how it goes longer term.\u201dFor those who are looking forward to or are curious about trying out alcohol-free living, even in the short-term, it\u2019s now easier than ever, Kuda says.\u201cThere are so many amazing non-alcoholic alternatives that you probably love to drink right now,\" Kuda says. \"There are non-alcoholic wines, spirits, beers, that come pretty close to the real thing. If you\u2019re looking for something special to enjoy, there are now so many options to make you feel included.\"Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

Here's how the experience has vastly changed in just a year.Thomas PalliniDecember 30, 2021, 3:02 PM\u00b76 min readGetting a COVID-19 test.Thomas Pallini/InsiderI tested positive for COVID-19 in December after testing positive for the virus in November 2020.My symptoms were mild both times, but the differences came in testing and the reaction of others.I didn't think I could get COVID-19 twice. But I couldn't have been more wrong and spent Christmas experiencing symptoms, scrounging for tests, and figuring out how to deal with COVID-19 all over again.On December 23, I tested positive for COVID-19 just 13 months after first testing positive for the virus in November 2020 and 9 months after receiving both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.After testing positive for COVID-19 the first time, my world stopped. But I knew what I had to do to isolate and quarantine. I was living with my parents at the time and retreated to my bedroom for a strict 14 days, having meals delivered and emerging, with a mask, only to use the bathroom. My parents even fled the house for two weeks when my sibling tested positive in early November.My symptoms were fairly mild, consisting of fatigue, chills, sore throat, and loss of taste and smell. Still, calls to friends and family members yielded gasps and extreme concern.While I felt fine, the knowledge that I had a virus inside of me that had killed more than 1 million people around the world weighed heavily on me. And as someone who is considered high risk, there was always the worry that even if I felt OK in the moment, things could get worse.The 14 days passed slowly, but after my isolation and recovery, the pandemic seemed over for me. I didn't think I could contract the virus again.Then I did, and my experience with COVID-19 the second time could not have been more different.On December 20, I felt a tickle in my throat that I could tell was the start of something bigger. I thought it was just a cold, given my recovery from COVID-19 in 2020, but decided to get tested in advance of Christmas.The testing apparatus in New York had gone from stellar to abysmal seemingly overnight. All of my go-to testing sites I tried to use had been overrun and people on social media were reporting that wait times soared to more than three hours at some locations. Result times have also been markedly longer at some locations, I've found.Story continuesSince testing sites were proving slow and unreliable, my first stop was a CVS Pharmacy to buy an at-home test, even though I thought it was unlikely that I contracted the virus again. But a run on COVID-19 tests meant that CVS was sold out. My local independent pharmacy, to my surprise, had the tests in stock.Store clerks were calling customers to tell them about the newly arrived supply of tests. It cost $30 to purchase a two-pack of rapid antigen tests, and I took the first test as soon as I got home. The result was negative.The next day, I woke up and signed on to work feeling lethargic and fatigued, in addition to the sore throat, but I still tested negative. I was also intermittently coughing up phlegm, but the cough didn't persist.I signed off early as I felt weak and rushed to lie down. I didn't run out to get another COVID-19 test because of the negative result I had received the night prior.The next day, a live-in family member called to tell us she had tested positive, even after testing positive in 2020, and we had all been exposed. I bought two more packs of tests from the same pharmacy, which had increased the price from $30 to $35.My 15-minute test came back positive. I ripped open the second test and 10 more nostril swabs revealed the same result.But unlike November 2020, I didn't know what to do. I didn't immediately know what the quarantine requirement was for a vaccinated person, I didn't know if there were any exceptions if that person had COVID-19 before, and I didn't know what resources were available to me.My immediate family, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, instantly came to terms with the fact that if I had the virus and they likely had it as well. They didn't feel the need to stay away from me. That was the most confusing to me: They seemed all right with contracting the same virus they were all afraid of just last year.Calls that I made to friends and family either resulted in surprise that someone could get COVID-19 twice or them telling me that they had tested positive themselves.Getting COVID-19 in New York City had seemingly gone from taboo to inescapable. Canceling Christmas was not on the table in my house since we were all exposed to the virus. I wasn't opposed to isolating for the holiday, but we resolved to quickly inform all of our planned guests so that they could make their own decisions on whether they would come.Some of our guests canceled, understandably, but others came as if nothing had happened.I spent Christmas Day, about five days after my first symptom, wearing a mask and staying away from visitors who were also undeterred by the COVID-19 case in the house. I was mostly able to stay 6 feet away from others but declined to participate in some festivities and took my meals in a different part of the house.My family members didn't treat my COVID-19 diagnosis as a threat at all, and that was something I couldn't fully comprehend. Even if the symptoms were mild, I wondered why anybody would want to increase their chances of getting sick.\"Come downstairs and take your mask off,\" one family member who had also contracted the virus in 2020 said, despite the fact that he obviously could contract the virus again, too.I'll end isolation soon. The symptoms weren't life-threatening and were no worse than a mild cold. The worst of my symptoms ended up being a sore throat and fatigue for a few days \u2014 though each person experiences this virus in their own way. I didn't even fully lose my sense of taste.Contracting COVID-19 is not the same as it was in 2020, and we have the tools to help ensure that many who contract the virus have a mild experience. I credit my quick recovery with being vaccinated and having natural immunity from my first round of COVID-19. If my recovery hadn't been quick, I'm heartened by the fact that new drugs are coming to market that can help reduce symptoms.I hope that, for me, the pandemic is finally over. But I've been wrong before.The experience of the author may be different from the experience of others who contract COVID-19 in the severity, type, and duration of symptoms.Read the original article on Business InsiderOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

It\u2019s not like before where you were coughing, couldn\u2019t say sentences and were short of breath,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Bai, an emergency medicine physician at Mount Sinai Queens in New York City.\u201cThere are obviously exceptions like if you start out with a very weakened immune system, your immune response won\u2019t be as strong with a booster. But in your average person, a booster\u2019s definitely going to make a difference is what I\u2019m seeing,\u201d he said.Dr. Joseph Varon, chief of critical care services and the Covid-19 unit at Houston\u2019s United Memorial Medical Center, said of the roughly 50 patients admitted to the hospital\u2019s Covid unit in the last four weeks, 100 percent of them were unvaccinated.He said patients who needed to be admitted typically have \u201cshortness of breath, high fevers, being dehydrated like crazy.\u201d He said those who are unvaccinated also \u201chave more illness. What I mean by more illness is more pneumonia, not just a little bit of pneumonia, you have a lot of pneumonia.\u201d\u201cThe people that are coming in unvaccinated have a much larger burden of illness in the lungs than those who are vaccinated,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, those who had received the booster shot were \u201calmost back to normal\u201d within several days, he said. Those who had not received the booster have tended to \u201cstill feel sick after a week, a week and a half or so,\u201d he added.Patients who have received the booster shot may still have symptoms such as a sore throat, a lot of fatigue and muscle pain, said Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Those who are vaccinated but have not got the booster \u201clooked worse, they looked like they felt pretty darn bad. But, again, they didn\u2019t need to be hospitalized,\u201d he said.Story continues\"I\u2019m not seeing people who have got two doses and a booster and are coming in profoundly short of breath,\" he said. \"It\u2019s just not happening.\"Those who are vaccinated but have not got a booster have shown symptoms such as more coughing, more fever and more fatigue than those who had received a booster, he said.Meanwhile, Spencer said almost every patient he has seen who needed to be admitted was unvaccinated.\u201cWe\u2019ve known that there are multiple presentations of this disease, that hasn\u2019t changed. What has changed is that we know that those who are vaccinated are significantly less likely to end up seeing me in the hospital and needing to be admitted. That\u2019s for certain,\u201d he said.The new omicron variant continues to spread rapidly in the United States, making up about 58 percent of all new Covid cases for the week ending Dec. 25, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Early evidence suggests that for most people, at least for those who are up to date on their Covid vaccines, omicron appears less likely to cause severe illness.A small study from the CDC published Tuesday suggested people who had Covid and are later reinfected with omicron may experience fewer symptoms than they did during their initial bout with the virus.And last week, reports out of the United Kingdom found that people who were infected with omicron in November and December were about two-thirds less likely to be hospitalized, compared with the delta variant.Physicians still stressed the importance of getting the vaccine and getting a booster, even if omicron appears less likely to lead to severe illness than delta.\u201cEspecially for those that are above 50-55, anyone with underlying medical conditions, we know that it can decrease the likelihood of you needing to be hospitalized with severe Covid,\u201d Spencer said.For those who are younger or without underlying medical conditions, he said, \u201cif you can prevent infections in younger folks, you can hopefully prevent infections in older folks, their grandparents, their parents or people that they see and mingle with, especially around the holidays.\u201d\u201cSo, I think from an infection prevention and control standpoint, getting a booster dose in younger folks, in addition to the benefit in terms of severe disease, is quite important,\u201d he said.Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

Researchers have speculated that other components of the immune response would still target Omicron, but there has been no proof until now.1d agoMiami HeraldChildren\u2019s hospitals are seeing record numbers of COVID patients.

They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Omicron cannot escape body's second-line defense\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A key part of the immune system's second-line defense - its T cells - are highly effective at recognizing and attacking the Omicron variant, thereby preventing most infections from progressing to critical illness, a new study shows.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Omicron's mutations help it escape from antibodies, the body's first line of defense against infection. Researchers have speculated that other components of the immune response would still target Omicron, but there has been no proof until now.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In test tube experiments, researchers in South Africa exposed copies of the virus to T cells from volunteers who had received vaccines from Johnson & Johnson or Pfizer/BioNTech or who had not been vaccinated but had developed their own T cells after infection with an earlier version of the coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Despite Omicron's extensive mutations and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, the majority of T cell response, induced by vaccination or natural infection, cross-recognizes the variant,\" the researchers reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well-preserved T cell immunity to Omicron is likely to contribute to protection from severe COVID-19,\" which supports what South African doctors had initially suspected when most patients with Omicron infections did not become seriously ill, they said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"T\" stands for thymus, the organ in which the cells' final stage of development occurs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Boosters reduce risk of Omicron household transmission\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The odds that vaccinated people will catch the virus if a household member becomes infected are nearly three to four times higher with Omicron than with Delta, but booster doses reduce that risk, new findings suggest.\u00a0Story continues\u00a0\u00a0Researchers analyzed transmission data collected from nearly 12,000 infected households in Denmark, including 2,225 households with an Omicron infection. Overall, there were 6,397 secondary infections in the week after the first infection in the house. After accounting for other risk factors, the rate of person-to-person spread of the virus to fully vaccinated people was roughly 2.6 times higher in Omicron households than in Delta households, the researchers reported on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Booster-vaccinated people were nearly 3.7 times more likely to get infected in the Omicron households than in the Delta households, they found.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking only at Omicron households, however, booster-vaccinated people were 56% less likely to become infected compared to vaccinated people who had not received a booster. And overall, when booster-vaccinated people were the ones who first brought home the virus, they were less likely than unvaccinated and vaccinated-but-not-boosted people to pass it to others.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Click for a Reuters graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/3c7R3Bl on vaccines in development.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Reporting by Nancy Lapid; Editing by Howard Goller)\u00a0Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

Researchers tracked data of over 69,000 workers between November 15 and December 20 after second doses of J&J vaccines were administered. The effectiveness at preventing hospitalization rose from 63% shortly after a booster to 84% 14 days later. Effectiveness reached 85% at one to two months post-boost.Linda-Gail Bekker, the co-lead investigator of the research said this is another piece of evidence that vaccines have not lost that impact even in the face of a very mutated variant. She added that the jury was \"still out\" on the issue of further boosters for the J&J vaccine.The J&J vaccine has also proven to be easier to transport to remote African rural areas than the rival, two-dose Pfizer vaccine due to better heat tolerance. While an initial course of inoculation has been shown to offer reduced protection against Omicron infection......several studies have suggested that a booster dose still provides significant protection against severe illness.10h agoYahoo FinanceOmicron prompts rethink of vaccine impact, COVID-19 mandatesSomeone has to say it, and I derive no pleasure from doing so.

Those suits have been withdrawn.Federal prosecutors have no plans to bring charges against Lesley Groff, an associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who was reportedly under criminal investigation for sex trafficking, according to her attorneys.Groff's lawyers, Michael Bachner and Jon Whitcomb, said Thursday in a statement provided to Insider that prosecutors in Manhattan would not file an indictment against their client.\"After a more than two-year investigation by the Department of Justice into Jeffrey Epstein's conduct, which included lengthy interviews of witnesses and a thorough review of relevant communications, we have been informed that no criminal charges will be brought against Lesley Groff,\" Bachner and Whitcomb said.The attorneys added that Groff \"never witnessed anything improper or illegal.\"The New York Times first reported in 2019 that federal prosecutors were considering sex-trafficking charges against Groff, who worked as an executive assistant for Epstein for nearly 20 years. A spokesperson for Groff told Insider that she was cooperating in the investigation.Groff was one of four Epstein employees named in a non-prosecution agreement the financier signed with federal prosecutors in Florida in 2007. The agreement, which has been widely criticized, allowed Epstein to serve a lenient sentence in Palm Beach County jail in Florida on prostitution solicitation charges rather than face a federal sex-trafficking indictment. The document also said that federal prosecutors would not bring criminal charges against Groff and the other women, who it described as \"potential co-conspirators.\"Story continuesFederal agents arrested Epstein in August 2019 following an investigation from Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown that exposed the scope of the agreement. He died in his jail cell while awaiting trial. In 2020, the FBI arrested Ghislaine Maxwell on suspicion of sex-trafficking girls to Epstein and sexually abusing them herself.Prior to her conviction, Maxwell argued that the same non-prosecution agreement protected her from all federal prosecution. US District Judge Alison Nathan, who oversaw her case, rejected that argument.Bachner had previously indicated that Groff would avoid prosecution, telling Brown for her book \"Perversion of Justice\" that federal prosecutors \"do not intend to bring criminal charges against Lesley Groff.\"A representative for the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which is conducting the investigation into the conduct of Epstein and his associates, declined to comment to Insider on the decision of whether to charge Groff.'The tip of the iceberg'A jury convicted Maxwell at trial on Wednesday. Maria Farmer, whose sister Annie Farmer testified against Maxwell at the trial, told Insider that while her family was \"elated by the verdict,\" the case was \"only the tip of the iceberg.\"\"As thrilled as I am by this arrest, it is only the tip of the iceberg,\" she said. \"There should be many to follow.\"Virginia Giuffre, who has also accused Epstein, Maxwell, and other associates of sexual misconduct, also said Wednesday that other people in their orbit must face justice.\"I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served,\" she said. \"Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be.\"Ghislaine Maxwell, the Jeffrey Epstein associate accused of sex trafficking, enters the court followed by U.S. court marshalls during her trial in a courtroom sketch in New York City, U.S., December 2, 2021.REUTERS/Jane RosenbergGroff's name came up several times in Maxwell's trial. One woman, who testified under the pseudonym \"Kate\" and said Epstein sexually abused her for years, said that Groff was one of Epstein's office assistants who booked flights for her to travel to his residences in New York, Palm Beach, and the US Virgin Islands. Larry Visoski and David Rodgers, two of Epstein's longtime private jet pilots, both said Groff was a secretary who worked for Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, and who scheduled flights for Epstein.According to her attorneys, Groff's job included \"making appointments for Epstein as directed by him, taking his messages, and setting up high-level meetings with CEOs, business executives, scientists, politicians, celebrities, charitable organizations, and universities.\"In a 2005 interview with the New York Times, Groff described herself as an extension of Epstein's brain.\"It comes down to the bond,\" she told the Times. \"I know what he is thinking and I know when I need to be fast. It's a nice roll we are on.\"In the same article, Epstein described Groff as so valuable that, when she became pregnant in 2004, he paid for a full-time nanny and brought her a Mercedes-Benz so that she could keep working for him.\"There is no way that I could lose Lesley to motherhood,\" Epstein told the Times.Epstein victims accused Groff of facilitating sexual abuseCivil lawsuits filed against Groff, all of which have since been dropped, depict her as one of Epstein's enablers.One lawsuit, filed in October by an anonymous \"Jane Doe,\" alleged Groff \"facilitated Epstein's trafficking and sexual abuse of Jane, including by purchasing plane tickets, sending money, making appointments, and sending various communications.\" The suit says Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York, France, the US Virgin Islands, and Florida between 2017 and 2019, up until Epstein was arrested. Groff also paid Jane cash after sexual encounters, the lawsuit alleges.Jane and Groff jointly agreed to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit with respect to Groff on Wednesday night, shortly after the verdict against Maxwell. The lawsuit is still pending with respect to allegations it made against Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, the executors of Epstein's estate, who have both denied any wrongdoing.Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New YorkAn attorney for Jane didn't immediately respond Thursday to Insider's request for comment. Bachner and Whitcomb said they were \"not surprised\" the case was dropped.\"Our hearts truly break for any person victimized by Epstein but the truth is \u2014 Lesley had no knowledge of and no participation in any of the illegal conduct alleged in the lawsuit,\" the attorneys said in a statement.At least two other accusers, Sarah Ransome and Jennifer Araoz, previously brought civil lawsuits against Groff. Both women dropped their litigation once they accepted money from the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program, which was established by Epstein's estate after his death to pay compensation to his victims. But as Insider previously reported, the program required claimants to abandon civil claims against the estate and Epstein's former employees, including Groff and Maxwell.Groff denied wrongdoing in Ransome and Araoz's lawsuits as well.

Family members rushed the 10-year-old to the hospital but she was pronounced dead soon after arriving.Nyla Anderson\u2019s family found her unconscious in her bedroom in Chester earlier this month. Family members rushed her to the hospital but she was pronounced dead soon after arriving. ABC7/ YouTube screenshot.During the \u201cBlackout Challenge\u201d participants perform some kind of auto-asphyxiation until they pass out. The challenge dates back prior to TikTok but the app has fueled a resurgence of the challenge. Users gain millions of views recording themselves taking part in challenges on TikTok.Nyla is the fifth child to die attempting the challenge this year. Oxygen deprivation can cause cardiac arrest, organ and brain damage or death.In March, 12-year-old Joshua Haileyesus died after spending 19 days in a Colorado hospital His family believes he accidentally choked himself with shoelaces while attempting the challenge.\u201cShe was a butterfly,\u201d Nyla\u2019s mother, Tawainna Anderson, told ABC7. \u201cShe was everything. She was a happy child.\u201d\u201cMake sure you check your kids\u2019 phones,\u201d Anderson added. \u201cYou never know what you might find on their phones. You wouldn\u2019t think 10-year-olds would try this. They\u2019re trying because they\u2019re kids and they don\u2019t know better.\u201dElizabeth Wood, a licensed clinical social worker at Nemours Children\u2019s Hospital, Delaware where Nyla recieved treatment, told \u201cToday\u201d that the girl has a history of viewing the challenge on social media.There are multiple variations of the challenge, which sometimes includes the use of something to cause choking or strangulation to stop the flow of oxygen.Videos of people participating in the challenge on TikTok have been removed. A search for the term \u201cBlackout Challenge\u201d on the app does not yield results.The social platform told The New York Post in a statement, \u201cThis disturbing \u2018challenge,\u2019 which people seem to learn about from sources other than TikTok, long predates our platform and has never been a TikTok trend.\u201dStory continuesThe statement continued, \u201cWe remain vigilant in our commitment to user safety and would immediately remove related content if found. Our deepest sympathies go out to the family for their tragic loss.\u201dNyla\u2019s family is mourning over the child\u2019s sudden death.\u201cShe was everything. She was a happy child,\u201d Anderson\u2019s mom said. \u201cThis is a pain that won\u2019t go away. It\u2019s at the top of my throat. I am so hurt.\u201dThe \u201cBlackout Challenge\u201d is not the first dangerous trend to be associated with TikTok. Viral videos of people stacking milk crates and walking across them spread rapidly on the app in August before the platform banned the challenge.After people were hospitalized with serious injuries after attempting the challenge, doctors warned against taking part in the challenge.More news from our partners:\u2018That\u2019s a Little F\u2014\u2014d Up of Y\u2019all\u2019: Viola Davis Reacts to Viral \u2018Walking Like Annalise\u2019 Challenge on TikTok\u201cIncredibly Grateful Just To Be Back In The Building\u201d | Kyrie Irving Returns To Practice For The Brooklyn Nets\u2018It\u2019s On Life Support\u2019: Last Black-Owned Bank In Chicago Struggles to Remain OpenOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

The warning signs, symptoms and risks according to an expertRead full articleAsymina Kantorowicz\u00b7WriterDecember 30, 2021, 11:58 AM\u00b75 min readLooking for more news on health and wellness? Sign up for Yahoo Lifestyle Canada\u2019s newsletter!Some memory loss may be due to aging, however progressive memory loss could be a sign of something more serious. (Getty Images)This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle.Forgetting where you put something or a failing to recall a person\u2019s name can happen to anyone. However it becomes much more distressing when frequent memory loss begins to affect our daily lives and in some cases, can eventually cause us to lose our independence.While impaired memory could be the result of infection, depression or anxiety or other medical conditions, it may also be due to dementia.\u00a0Impaired memory loss may be due to dementia, which impacts more than half a million Canadians and is expected to nearly double by 2030, according to the Alzheimer Society of Canada.\u00a0What is dementia?Dementia is not a disease, but a general term used to refer to disorders that cause progressive loss of cognitive functioning, which means it affects your way of thinking, remembering and reasoning. Many people who are diagnosed with dementia can also experience changes in their mood and personality.More than 500,000 Canadians live with dementia or Alzheimer's disease (a form of dementia). As our population ages, experts project the number of people living with some from of dementia to be as high as 930,000 by 2030.\u00a0What are the warning signs of dementia? (Getty Images).What causes dementia?Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that primarily or secondarily affect the brain.Are dementia and Alzheimer's disease the same thing?Although they are often used interchangeably, Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. According to the World Health Organization saying it contributes to 60-70% of dementia cases. Many people use the terms \"dementia\" and \"Alzheimer's\" interchangeably, but in reality Alzheimers is the cause and dementia is the effect.Story continuesStroke, head injuries and even Parkinson\u2019s disease are also causes of dementia.What are common symptoms of dementia?According to experts, the most common symptom of dementia is short-term memory loss. This includes forgetting something that happened or was said within the last 10-15 minutes, repeating oneself and asking the same questions.Dr. Andrew Frank, a cognitive neurologist at the Bruyere Memory Program at Ottawa\u2019s Elisabeth Bruyere Hospital, lists other symptoms as deterioration in language, words and judgement.The odd forgetfulness of a word or name that comes back to you later is normal, especially as we age or if we are stressed or sleep deprived. It\u2019s when the memories are not coming back at all that's a signal of a much deeper problem.Progressive memory loss can lead to a loss of independence. (Getty Images)\u201cOne of the rules of thumb is that if you\u2019re realizing your own memory problem, that\u2019s a good sign because you\u2019re remembering you\u2019re forgetting,\u201d Frank explains in an interview with Yahoo Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s more serious if you are not realizing that you\u2019re forgetting, meaning you\u2019re forgetting that you\u2019re forgetting and that can be a sign of something more serious like dementia.\u201dWhat to do if you suspect your family member is showing symptoms of dementiaIf you notice a change in a family member's ability to recall information, repeating themselves, becoming confused, struggling with their vocabulary or completing tasks that would otherwise seem easy (like shopping or driving to a familiar location), consider accompanying them to an appointment with their family doctor as soon as possible.A doctor can perform memory tests and others to measure blood pressure and check levels of various chemicals, hormones and vitamins in the body. The family physician can refer the patient to a memory clinic as well, where more testing can be done to determine if the diagnosis is dementia.Who is the most at risk of developing dementia?When it comes to dementia there are some risks that we can and can\u2019t control.Factors that we can\u2019t control that increase our risk of developing dementia are age (one in 20 Canadians over 65 have Alzheimer\u2019s disease), genetics and sex; women have a greater chance of developing dementia than men.\u00a0Women are at an increased risk of developing dementia. (Getty Images)The good news is that there are things we can control that can help minimize our risk of developing dementia. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and diet are both recommended. Making sure you\u2019re physically active everyday is important and Frank insists exercising your brain is equally as crucial through hobbies and puzzles.\u00a0Eliminating smoking and excessive alcohol consumption while adhering to a wholesome diet like the Mediterranean diet can help keep your body and mind in shape.\u201cAnother strategy is to watch out for high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes and to treat those because any factors that prevent heart attack and stroke will also prevent or delay dementia,\u201d Franks says.Can early detection help prevent or treat dementia?While there is no cure for dementia, early detection can be beneficial with putting systems in place before these symptoms worsen.If someone is diagnosed at an earlier stage, they can begin memory treatments and take medications that can help manage the condition. Doctors also suggest putting home care and day programs in place as additional supports.\"Someone who has not been diagnosed may have a crisis of memory loss where they might be missing their medications or not eating due to forgetfulness which would then lead to a sudden health crisis and hospitalization,\u201d Frank says.Let us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

And the program, it was set up by the company's founders to help people understand what this company actually do-- does and helps probably make it even better moving forward. And the pay for this person that reportedly made these comments, $400,000 a year, what looks to be a program developer.And, Julie, my hot take is very simple and probably not unlike many others out there. Get off your rear. Put down the $500 video game headsets. Put down the $12 green drink and the Snickers bar. Get out of your parents' basement or wherever you might be, that dark room where you're coding. Go out there and make a delivery. Understand the business.You know, I can't tell you how incredibly helpful it is when you're in positions like that to just know how the business operates from the ground floor so you could, in fact, make it better. My hat goes off to the executive team and the cofounders of DoorDash for even coming up with this program. It's very, very important.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it seems bizarre that people would complain about having to do this once a month. I mean, I would think that at any tech company this kind of thing should be mandatory, right? Any company for which someone is programming, but really all the employees of the company, should be encouraged to use the product of the company in an intense way on a regular basis because that's the best way to figure out if it's working, right? Because here we're talking about the app that the drivers are using as well as just kind of seeing how the business works. So I agree with you.Story continues[PHONE RINGING]I think there's no other take that could be had. Oh, are we ringing? Are we ringing, Brian Sozzi?BRIAN SOZZI: It's not a DoorDash. It's not DoorDash [INAUDIBLE] have to take care of, Julie. But, you know, hey, we're working out of our living rooms. That's what we have to deal with.But, look, I will say this. When you make that type of money, $400,000, you have an extra responsibility to understand what the business does at the very ground floor. And it is ridiculous to see that employee who makes that money taking to the internal message board and demanding that that should have been put in the offer letter. No, it shouldn't. And what you need to do is roll up your sleeves and get the job done.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious. Obviously, you're getting a DoorDash delivery. Maybe it's almost lunchtime in the Sozzi household. I don't know.But what's also interesting, to take a step back and look at the markets before we leave today, is just that as we've been discussing this incredible, incredible resilience that we are seeing-- and again, if we're looking at a Santa Claus rally, that would mean a rally positive on the last five days of the year, first two sessions of the next year. We're well on our way with this seven-day streak now that the Dow has been on and with the S&P 500 continuing to notch records. I know you like those kinds of positive vibes going into a new year.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, and I dig the positive vibes. Good to see the market is where it is.

For me, that was former House Speaker Jim Wright. In 1982, the Fort Worth congressman hired me as a summer intern, and I became a permanent staffer to the second-most powerful person in the U.S. for nine years. As a result, I was able to finish college and law school at night while working for the man I greatly admired.Story continuesI ask all of you to think of that one person in your lives and drop them a note of appreciation during the holidays.

If you have not seen the ceremony, watch it, and keep a tissue at hand.The Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol was not carried out by patriots but by puppets maneuvered by the former president and his minions.

Firefighters contained a blaze that raged for hours in Syria's port of Latakia on Tuesday, officials said, hours after Israel launched missiles from the Mediterranean Sea, igniting the fire in the container terminal. It was the second such attack on the vital facility this month. (Planet Labs PBC via AP)December 30, 2021, 6:24 AM\u00b72 min readBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Satellite images taken this week over the Syrian port of Latakia show the smoldering wreckage after a reported Israeli missile strike, hours after firefighters contained a massive blaze.The raid launched from the Mediterranean Sea Tuesday was among the biggest launched by Israel into Syria, igniting a fire in the container terminal that raged for hours and caused significant material damage in the vicinity. It damaged a nearby hospital and offices, and also shattered windows of residential buildings and cars parked in the area near the port. The explosion could be heard miles away.It was the second such attack on the facility this month.The Latakia seaport handles most of the imports to Syria, a country ravaged by a decade-old civil war and Western-imposed sanctions. Another attack took place Dec. 7, when Syrian media reported Israeli warplanes hit the container terminal, also igniting a major fire.Satellite photos obtained by The Associated Press from Planet Labs PBC Thursday showed heavy smog over the container terminal on Wednesday, likely from the struck container still smoking. The images suggest it was a high precision strike that appeared to hit one container.A Syrian military official said the Israeli missiles were fired from the sea, west of Latakia, hitting the terminal and igniting fires. Maj. Mohannad Jafaar, head of the Latakia fire department, said 12 fire trucks worked for hours to contain the blaze. He said the containers that were hit held spare auto parts and oil but there were no casualties.The Israeli military, which rarely comments on individual attacks or discusses details of such operations, declined to comment on the reported strike.Israel says it targets bases of Iran-allied militias, such as Lebanon\u2019s militant Hezbollah group, which has fighters in Syria. It says it attacks arms shipments believed to be bound for the militias.Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

Thousands of flights have been canceled amid staffing shortages blamed on the virus.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease expert, said Wednesday that there is no need to cancel small home gatherings among vaccinated and boosted family and friends.But \"if your plans are to go to a 40- to 50-person New Year\u2019s Eve party with all the bells and whistles and everybody hugging and kissing and wishing each other a happy new year, I would strongly recommend that this year we not do that,\u201d he said.The threat of omicron and the desire to spend the holidays with friends and loved ones have spurred many Americans to get tested for COVID-19.Aravindh Shankar, 24, flew to San Jose, California, on Christmas from West Lafayette, Indiana, to be with family. Though he felt fine, he decided to get tested Wednesday just to play it safe, since he had been on an airplane.He and his family spent almost an entire day searching for a testing appointment for him before he went to a site in a parking lot next to the San Jose airport.\u201cIt was actually surprisingly hard,\u201d Shankar said about trying to find a test. \u201cSome people have it harder for sure.\u201dThe picture is grim elsewhere around the world, especially in Europe, with World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying he is worried about omicron combining with the delta variant to produce a \u201ctsunami\u201d of cases. That, he said, will put \u201cimmense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse.\u201dStory continuesThe number of Americans now in the hospital with COVID-19 is running at around 60,000, or about half the figure seen in January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.While hospitalizations sometimes lag behind cases, the hospital figures may reflect both the protection conferred by the vaccine and the possibility that omicron is not making people as sick as previous versions.COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have climbed over the past two weeks from an average of 1,200 per day to around 1,500.Public health experts will be closely watching the numbers in the coming week for indications of the vaccines' effectiveness in preventing serious illness, keeping people out of the hospital and relieving strain on exhausted health care workers, said Bob Bednarczyk, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University.CDC data already suggests that the unvaccinated are hospitalized at much higher rates than those who have gotten inoculated, even if the effectiveness of the shots decreases over time, he said.\u201cIf we're able to weather this surge with hopefully minimal disruptions to the overall health care system, that is a place where vaccines are really showing their worth,\u201d Bednarczyk said.It's highly unlikely that hospitalization numbers will ever rise to their previous peak, said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School Public Health. Vaccines and treatments developed since last year have made it easier to curb the spread of the virus and minimize serious effects among people with breakthrough infections.\u201cIts going to take some time for people to get attuned to the fact that cases don't matter the same way they did in the past,\u201d Adalja said. \u201cWe have a lot of defense against it.\"But even with fewer people hospitalized compared with past surges, the virus can wreak havoc on hospitals and health care workers, he added.\u201cIn a way, those hospitalizations are worse because they're all preventable,\u201d he said.Several European countries, including France, Greece, Britain and Spain, also reported record case counts this week, prompting a ban on music at New Year\u2019s celebrations in Greece and a renewed push to encourage vaccination by French authorities.WHO reported that new COVID-19 cases worldwide increased 11% last week from the week before, with nearly 4.99 million recorded Dec. 20-26. But the U.N. health agency also noted a decline in cases in South Africa, where omicron was first detected just over a month ago.___ Associated Press writer Terry Tang in San Jose, California, contributed to this report.Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

They said they had responded to \u201ca disturbance call involving an unruly passenger.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWhen the aircraft arrived at the gate, officers were able to meet with exiting passengers who advised that the suspect, Ms. Patricia Cornwall had caused a disturbance while in the air,\u201d police wrote. \u201cThis disturbance lead [sic] to the injury of fellow passengers and Delta employees.\u201dFrom there, they handed her off to FBI agents.\u00a0Cornwall made her first appearance on Monday afternoon in federal court in Atlanta where she did not submit a plea nor was required to, CNN reports. She is accused of \"assault by striking, beating, or wounding R.S.M. [the victim] in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States,\" a criminal complaint, obtained by CNN, states.Video: Travel plans remain in limbo due to weather, COVID complicationsIn the federal complaint, investigators said they interviewed the victim, a male passenger, and watched a cellphone video of the incident which they say corroborated his story. That passenger alleged that Cornwall was told by a flight attendant to take a spare seat after using the restroom so the attendant could complete beverage service.Cornwall then allegedly asked the flight attendant, 'What am I, Rosa Parks?'\"\u00a0Rosa Parks was a civil rights activist who refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger in 1955 in then-segregated Alabama.The alleged victim told the FBI that he then \"told Cornwall it was an inappropriate comment and that she 'isn't Black....this isn't Alabama and this isn't a bus,'\" according to the complaint.Story continuesThe man also told Cornwall to \"sit down Karen,\" according to the complaint. The pair then got into a dispute, which also involved masks, according to purported video of the event posted by ATL Uncensored. In it, a woman yells at an older man, who has a bottle of water in his hand, to pull up his mask as she is standing in the aisle with her mask down. In that video, a woman can be seen striking the male passenger before making a closed fist.\"Situations like these are rare for the vast majority of our customers and Delta has zero tolerance for unruly behavior at our airports and aboard our aircraft,\u201d a spokesperson for Delta told Oxygen.com in a statement via email on Wednesday morning.Cornwall, whose stage name is Patty Breton, is a former NFL cheerleader as well as an actor who once had a part in \u201cBaywatch\u201d and \u201cMarried with Children,\u201d the New York Post reports. She is currently a real estate agent.She has had other issues with the law, most recently in November when she allegedly became aggressive with officers after she crashed into a tree in Florida, according to the New York Post. She was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence and careless driving and is due back court in connection with that incident on Jan. 10. Last year, she pleaded no contest to having a blood alcohol content level of 0.08 percent or more in Los Angeles and was sentenced to 36 months of summary probation. Her sister-in-law also filed for domestic violence protection against her last year after Cornwall allegedly threatened to kill her, according to the outlet. That order of protection was granted by a judge.Cornwall could face up to one year in prison and up to a $100,000 fine. She has posted a $20,000 bond at her arraignment.

What happened: TikTok user @labellamonay shared the incident on Sunday, and the clip has been viewed more than 1.1 million times at the time of this writing.In the two-minute video, the TikTok user confronts an Asian server of Fox Valley Mall\u2019s Nori Japan in Aurora, Illinois, after he allegedly refused to serve the woman\u2019s sister, because she is Black.@labellamonay argues that her sister is paying the man for her order, but he still refuses to serve her, because a Black customer did not pay for their meal earlier that day.\u201c\u2018Cause she\u2019s Black? \u2018Cause another Black person took your food and didn\u2019t pay, you\u2019re not going to serve my sister?\u201d the TikTok user asks. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, sir. That\u2019s discrimination. You can\u2019t tell her you\u2019re not going to serve her, \u2018cause she\u2019s Black because of what someone else did today.\u201d\u201cYou people no pay money,\u201d the man replies. The TikTok user then asks, \"What does that have to do with us? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, sir. We\u2019re not affiliated with them.\"\u201cI thought I would never have to do something like this,\u201d the woman can be heard saying in the video. \u201cWell, what\u2019s worse, the person that we don\u2019t know not paying you $5 or us suing you for discrimination?\u201dThe man then replies, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Same face.\u201d  The reaction: Many users\u2019 reactions were divided, with some defending the Asian server and others calling him out for discrimination.\u201cHe\u2019s wrong but I also understand him this man is traumatized and hurt. Understanding should come from both sides,\u201d one TikTok user said.However, @labellamonay called out everyone who was defending the man by posting another video showing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which \u201cprohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin.\u201dStory continues@labellamonayReply to @aidan_sn07 #greenscreen Smh.\u266c original sound - Labella Monay \ud83c\udf39 \u201cI\u2019m half Asian and I\u2019m sick of my people DEFENDING people like him just cuz he\u2019s old and doesn\u2019t speak English much. He\u2019s a grown adult,\u201d a TikTok user wrote.\u201cI do not understand how y\u2019all are looking at obvious discrimination and choose to defend this man,\u201d another user wrote.

In 2019, I was aboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer, a 308-foot-long scientific research vessel, cruising in front of the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica. One day, we were sailing in clear seas in front of the glacier. The next day, we were surrounded by icebergs the size of aircraft carriers.As we later learned from satellite images, in a matter of 48 hours or so, a m\u00e9lange of ice about 21 miles wide and 15 miles deep had cracked up and scattered into the sea.More from Rolling StoneCOP26 Agreement Is 'Not Enough' to Stave Off Global Climate Disaster, UN Chief SaysDemocrats Are Coming After Big Oil Over the Industry's Endless Climate BullshitReport: Plastic May Soon Overtake Coal as a Climate KillerIt was a spooky moment. Thwaites Glacier is the size of Florida. It is the cork in the bottle of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet, which contains enough ice to raise sea levels by 10 feet. The m\u00e9lange that disintegrated was not part of the glacier itself, but a mix of icebergs and sea ice that had cozied up next to it. Still, the idea that it could just fall apart overnight was mind-blowing.The research vessel \u2018Nathaniel B. Palmer\u2019 was surrounded overnight by icebergs while exploring the Thwaites Glacier in 2019. - Credit: Alex MazurAlex MazurAs it turns out, the ice breakup I witnessed was not a freak event. A few weeks ago, scientists participating in the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a $25 million five-year-long joint research program between the National Science Foundation in the U.S. and the Natural Environment Research Council in the U.K., presented their latest research. They described the discovery of cracks and fissures in the Thwaites eastern ice shelf, predicting that the ice shelf could fracture like a shattered car window in as little as five years. \u201cIt won\u2019t scatter out into sea as quickly as what you saw when you were down there,\u201d Erin Pettit, a glaciologist at Oregon State University and one of the lead principal investigators in the ITGC, later told me. \u201cBut the basic process is the same. The ice shelf is breaking up and could be gone in less than a decade.\u201dStory continuesGiven the ongoing war for American democracy and the deadly toll of the Covid pandemic, the loss of an ice shelf on a far-away continent populated by penguins might not seem to be big news. But in fact, the West Antarctic ice sheet is one of the most important tipping points in the Earth\u2019s climate system. If Thwaites Glacier collapses, it opens the door for the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet to slide into the sea. Globally, 250 million people live within three feet of high tide lines. Ten feet of sea level rise would be a world-bending catastrophe. It\u2019s not only goodbye Miami, but goodbye to virtually every low-lying coastal city in the world.But predicting the breakup of ice sheets and the implications for future sea level rise is fraught with uncertainty. Depending on various emissions scenarios in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, we could have as little as one foot of sea level rise by the end of the century, or nearly six feet of sea level rise (of course, rising seas won\u2019t stop in 2100, but that date has become a common benchmark). \u201cThe difference between those [models] is a lot of lives and money,\u201d says Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Penn State University and one of the great ice scientists of our time. Alley adds: \u201cThe most likely place to generate [the worst scenario] is Thwaites.\u201dOr to put it more urgently: \u201cIf there is going to be a climate catastrophe,\u201d Ohio State glaciologist Ian Howat once told me, \u201cit\u2019s probably going to start at Thwaites.\u201dThe problem is, understanding what\u2019s going on at Thwaites is fiendishly complex. As I wrote in 2017:The trouble with Thwaites, which is one of the largest glaciers on the planet, is that it\u2019s also what scientists call \u201ca threshold system.\u201d That means instead of melting slowly like an ice cube on a summer day, it is more like a house of cards: It\u2019s stable until it is pushed too far, then it collapses.Thwaites is very different from other big glaciers, such as those in Greenland. For one thing, it is not melting from above, due to warmer air temperatures. It\u2019s melting from below, due to warmer ocean water eating away at its underbelly. More importantly, the terrain beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet is peculiar. \u201cThink of it as a giant soup bowl filled with ice,\u201d Sridhar Anandakrishnan, an expert in polar glaciology at Penn State University, once told me. In the bowl analogy, the edge of the glacier \u2014 the spot where a glacier leaves the land and begins to float \u2014 is perched on the lip of the bowl 1,000 feet or more below sea level. Scientists call that lip the \u201cgrounding line.\u201d Below the lip, the terrain falls away on a downward slope for hundreds of miles, all the way to the Transantarctic Mountains that divide East and West Antarctica. At the deepest part of the basin, the ice is about two miles thick.What this means is that once the warm water gets below ice, it can flow down the slope of the bowl, weakening the ice from below. Through a mechanism called \u201cmarine ice-cliff Instability,\u201d you can get what amounts to a runaway collapse of the ice sheet that could raise global sea levels very high, very fast.That\u2019s why, when I wrote my 2017 Rolling Stone story about Thwaites, I dubbed it \u201cThe Doomsday Glacier.\u201d (The name stuck \u2014 if you type the phrase into Google now, you get half a million hits.)In a worst-case scenario, how fast could Thwaites collapse? No one knows. The IPCC data is the best guide for sea level rise for the rest of this century, although Alley cautions me that even six feet of sea level rise by 2100 is not the worst-case scenario.\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what the upper boundary is for how fast this can happen,\u201d Alley says. \u201cWe are dealing with an event that no human has ever witnessed before. We have no analog for this.\u201dIn the past few years, scientists have made a lot of progress in understanding the dynamics of Thwaites. On our 2019 cruise, scientists discovered troughs in the seabed that allowed warm water to flow underneath the ice shelf. Scientists have mapped the underside of the glacier itself, tracked crevasses in the ice shelf, and located pinning points that might slow the retreat of the ice. The change has been dramatic: \u201cThe net rate of ice loss from Thwaites Glacier is more than six times what it was in the early 1990s,\u201d says Rob Larter, a geophysicist with the British Antarctic Survey who was the chief scientist on my trip to Antarctica in 2019.The recent news about Thwaites\u2019 eastern ice shelf breaking up in the next five years was not really a surprise to anyone who has been tracking the science closely. After the sudden disintegration of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002, scientists realized that Antarctica was far less stable than many had believed. The discovery of cracks and fissures at Thwaites further underscore just how dynamic the changes already underway are.A newly discovered fissure in the Thwaites ice shelf. Scientists predict the shelf could crack like a car window in five years. - Credit: Erin PettitErin PettitTo be clear, there is a big difference between an ice shelf and the glacier itself. The ice shelf is like a thumbnail that grows out from the glacier and floats on the ocean. Because it is already floating, when it melts it doesn\u2019t in itself contribute to sea level rise (just as when ice cubes melt in your glass, they don\u2019t raise the level of liquid).But ice shelves are important because they buttress glaciers. Like the flying buttresses of Notre Dame, they give the walls of ice stability. And when they break up, the land-based glacier is free to flow much faster into the sea. And that does raise sea levels.So yeah, if Thwaites loses a significant part of its ice shelf in five years, that\u2019s a big deal.But even if a big part of the ice shelf does crack up, there is a lot of unknown complexity in how it will play out. \u201cA first question is, if the ice-shelf breakage continues, will the whole ice shelf be lost, or will a short ice shelf remain, at least in some places?\u201d Richard Alley emailed me. \u201cAlmost all ice-shelf ice is buttressing, generating friction that holds back the non-floating ice, so loss of part, most or all of the ice shelf will increase flow of non-floating ice into the ocean. But the most-important buttressing tends to arise closest to the grounding zone, so if a short ice shelf does remain, it may still provide important buttressing, and the speedup of flow and thinning will be smaller than they could be with full ice-shelf loss.\u201dHere you see the problem. Even predicting how the crackup of the ice shelf will impact the flow of the glacier is difficult to estimate.And this is only one of the uncertainties that scientists face when trying to predict whether or not Miami will be underwater by 2100. There is further uncertainty in exactly where and when the ice will fracture, how much warm water will be pushed up beneath the glacier by changing winds and ocean currents, how the character of the bed the glacier rests on will speed up or slow down the glacier\u2019s slide into the sea. Whether the bed is hard rock or muddy till can have a big impact on the velocity of the glacier, just as the texture of snow affects how fast you ski down a mountain. \u201cIce is alive,\u201d says Pettit. \u201cIt moves and flows and breaks in ways that are difficult to anticipate.\u201dParadoxically, the more scientists learn about what\u2019s going on at Thwaites, the more divergent the latest climate models have become about its future. Consider the results of two models by highly respected scientists published side by side in Nature earlier this year. One model suggests that Thwaites stays fairly stable until temperatures rise above 2 C of warming. Then all hell breaks loose. Thwaites begins to fall into the sea like a line of dominoes pushed off a table and soon takes the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet with it. And once the collapse begins, according to this model, it will be impossible to stop \u2014 at least on any human time scale. In a century or so, global sea levels could rise 10 feet, which would swamp South Florida and Bangladesh and many other low-lying regions of the world.In the other model, global sea level rise only differs by 4\u00bd inches between a 1.5 C global temperature rise and a 3 C temperature rise (which is a little above where we are headed with under current emissions scenarios). And much of that comes from increased melt in Greenland and mountain glaciers. As for Antarctica, the paper says explicitly: \u201cNo clear dependence on emissions scenario emerges for Antarctica.\u201dSo what to make of all this?\u201cThe current divergence among model predictions is actually a good sign because it means that scientists are probing different parameterizations, representations of processes, and hypotheses,\u201d writes Jeremy Bassis, a geophysicist at the University of Michigan. Bassis suggests not focusing so much on the long-term uncertainty and highlighting instead what scientists know about the next few decades. \u201cThe skill of models in predicting sea level change on decadal time scales is high, and we already have actionable projections on these time scales. We should be emphasizing that fact in discussions with community members, stakeholders, and decision-makers, so they can move ahead with important adaptation and mitigation planning.\u201dBut in the long run, it is not clear that the dynamics of ice sheet collapse that are underway at Thwaites can be stopped. As glaciologist Eric Rignot put it in 2015, in Antarctica, \u201cthe fuse has been blown.\u201d Even if we cut carbon emissions to zero tomorrow, warm water will continue to flow beneath the ice sheet for decades, destabilizing the ice and further pushing the glacier toward eventual collapse. This doesn\u2019t means that cutting carbon pollution to zero isn\u2019t an important goal \u2014 nothing, in fact, is more important or more urgent. \u201cWe may have a small safety margin in Antarctica, but not a large one,\u201d says Alley. Even if the fuse is blown, cutting emissions fast could slow it all down to a millennium-long crack-up that will give us more time to adapt. One way or another, our future is written in ice.Contributing editor Jeff Goodell has written extensively about the Doomsday Glacier.

(AP) \u2014 A New Hampshire woman violated the state's civil rights law by calling a Black child by a racial slur and threatening to kneel on his neck, a court ruled Wednesday.Kristina Graper, 51, of Dover, was accused of threatening the 9-year-old in May after he accidentally broke her son's toy at a local park. She was prosecuted by the attorney general's Civil Rights Unit in Strafford County Superior Court, which concluded that her conduct was motivated by the victim's race and was intended to terrorize or coerce him.Graper, whose race was not mentioned in the complaint, has been prohibited from contacting the boy or his family or coming within 250 feet of them. She also was given a $2,500 civil penalty, with all but $500 suspended if she complies.Graper did not file a response to attorney general\u2019s complaint. A phone number listed for her attorney was disconnected.The complaint said the encounter distressed the child, who understood the comments to be a reference to the murder of George Floyd last year. He began to cry when he heard her words and has been afraid to return to the park, and will only do so \u201cwhen other children are there to help keep him safe,\u201d the complaint said.Millions of people watched the footage of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, pleading for air as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck until he stopped breathing. Former Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted in April of murder and manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death.Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

They are still barred from voting in state or federal elections.Noncitizen voting was widespread throughout the U.S. in the years after the nation\u2019s founding, though voting rights were extended only to white, land-owning men at the time. Over time, the practice was gradually rolled back. By the mid-1920s, no state allowed noncitizens to vote. In 1996, Congress made it illegal for a noncitizen to vote in a federal election.When it\u2019s new law goes into effect, New York will be by far the largest city to have noncitizen voting in all citywide races. Some big cities, like San Francisco and Chicago, allow noncitizens to vote, but only in local school elections. Currently only a handful of small municipalities in the U.S. \u2014 11 in Maryland and two in Vermont\u2014 grant noncitizens full voting rights for local contests. At least 45 other countries allow noncitizens to vote in some, and in some cases all, elections.Why there\u2019s debateAdvocates for noncitizen voting rights hope that their victory in the nation\u2019s largest city will be a breakthrough that spurs a similar movement in cities across the country. They argue that it\u2019s immoral to deny people who work, raise families and pay taxes in a community the right to have a say in decisions that affect them just as much as their neighbors.Backers also say that noncitizens voting would\u00a0bring important issues that currently don\u2019t get the attention they deserve into the center of the political debate. These backers\u00a0also make the case that permitting immigrants to participate in American democracy will help them become \u201cmore interested and engaged\u201d in the communities in which they live.Story continuesCritics say giving voting rights to noncitizens would dilute one of the core things that makes being an American citizen special. Many conservatives also argue that the push for noncitizen voting rights is a cynical\u00a0play by Democrats to expand their voter base, as the party takes more pro-immigration stances than Republicans.What\u2019s nextThe upcoming action is all on the local level. Several more municipalities \u2014 including cities in Illinois, Maine and Massachusetts \u2014 are considering noncitizen voting in the near future. Conservative lawmakers have also launched an effort to head off a potential expansion of noncitizen voting. Florida, Colorado and Alabama all passed ballot measures last year limiting voting only to citizens.PerspectivesSupportersIt\u2019s unfair to deny people a say in elections that have a major impact on their lives\u201cOn the face of it, noncitizen voting is a matter of basic fairness. People who live, work and pay taxes in our communities should have a say in how they are governed.\u201d \u2014 Tali Farhadian Weinstein, NBC NewsNoncitizen voting will force candidates to consider a broader set of issues\u201cThe West\u2019s resident foreigner communities are diverse. They include both indigent refugees and highly compensated expats, construction workers and software engineers, taxi drivers and bestselling authors. The political agendas they could advocate if they had a voice, and a vote, would include a correspondingly broad range of issues.\u201d \u2014 Leonid Bershidsky, BloombergNoncitizens will become more invested in their communities\u201cAllowing people to vote gives them even more of a sense of investment in their towns, cities, communities and country. There\u2019s a detachment that comes with not being able to vote in the place where you live. Concerns about mixed loyalties, meanwhile, are misplaced.\u201d \u2014 Atossa Araxia Abrahamian, New York TimesNoncitizen voting is an opportunity to counter attacks on voting rights\u201cIndeed, this celebration of democracy by expanding the right to vote is even more important now, after a raucous primary season and when reactionary forces in places like Georgia and Texas are trying to chip away at this precious right.\u201d \u2014 Murad Awawdeh, Daily NewsPlaces that enact noncitizen voting have been shown to benefit\u201cYou can move to Ireland and in six months vote in national elections. And they\u2019ve seen, you know, a significant turnout to good effect. There\u2019s a number of studies that have shown how when immigrants participate, there\u2019s increases in and improvements in education policy and outcomes.\u201d \u2014 Ron Hayduk, voting rights historian, The NationOpponentsNoncitizen voting rights would dilute the special bond citizens have with this country\u201cVoting in a modern democracy is tied to citizenship and the duties and rights that attend it, which is why the franchise is generally limited to those people who have established, either by birth or oath, a deep connection to the nation. Authorizing noncitizen voting would devalue citizenship, a bedrock of American life.\u201d \u2014 Seth Barron, City JournalDemocrats are trying to expand their voter base to tip elections in their favorNon-citizen voting is the latest push by progressives \u2014 along with felon voting and mass amnesty \u2014 who fear that they cannot win elections conducted only among law-abiding American citizens.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, National ReviewOne of the main arguments raised by supporters is illogical\u201cThe taxation argument isn\u2019t persuasive. Nonresidents with second homes or apartments in the city pay property taxes, and they certainly have an interest in public services like police, fire and garbage collection. International students live in New York, and they might pay taxes of all kinds, or at least sales taxes on whatever they buy. Does that mean they should get to vote in local races? The obvious answer is no.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, Wall Street JournalNoncitizen voting rights should start small\u201cThe expansion of the franchise should be narrow. It should be for school board elections only, and it could be restricted to legal permanent residents with children in the system. Let\u2019s try it and see what happens.\u201d \u2014 Nicholas Goldberg, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you\u2019d like to see covered in \u201cThe 360\u201d?

They are still barred from voting in state or federal elections.Noncitizen voting was widespread throughout the U.S. in the years after the nation\u2019s founding, though voting rights were extended only to white, land-owning men at the time. Over time, the practice was gradually rolled back. By the mid-1920s, no state allowed noncitizens to vote. In 1996, Congress made it illegal for a noncitizen to vote in a federal election.When it\u2019s new law goes into effect, New York will be by far the largest city to have noncitizen voting in all citywide races. Some big cities, like San Francisco and Chicago, allow noncitizens to vote, but only in local school elections. Currently only a handful of small municipalities in the U.S. \u2014 11 in Maryland and two in Vermont\u2014 grant noncitizens full voting rights for local contests. At least 45 other countries allow noncitizens to vote in some, and in some cases all, elections.Why there\u2019s debateAdvocates for noncitizen voting rights hope that their victory in the nation\u2019s largest city will be a breakthrough that spurs a similar movement in cities across the country. They argue that it\u2019s immoral to deny people who work, raise families and pay taxes in a community the right to have a say in decisions that affect them just as much as their neighbors.Backers also say that noncitizens voting would\u00a0bring important issues that currently don\u2019t get the attention they deserve into the center of the political debate. These backers\u00a0also make the case that permitting immigrants to participate in American democracy will help them become \u201cmore interested and engaged\u201d in the communities in which they live.Story continuesCritics say giving voting rights to noncitizens would dilute one of the core things that makes being an American citizen special. Many conservatives also argue that the push for noncitizen voting rights is a cynical\u00a0play by Democrats to expand their voter base, as the party takes more pro-immigration stances than Republicans.What\u2019s nextThe upcoming action is all on the local level. Several more municipalities \u2014 including cities in Illinois, Maine and Massachusetts \u2014 are considering noncitizen voting in the near future. Conservative lawmakers have also launched an effort to head off a potential expansion of noncitizen voting. Florida, Colorado and Alabama all passed ballot measures last year limiting voting only to citizens.PerspectivesSupportersIt\u2019s unfair to deny people a say in elections that have a major impact on their lives\u201cOn the face of it, noncitizen voting is a matter of basic fairness. People who live, work and pay taxes in our communities should have a say in how they are governed.\u201d \u2014 Tali Farhadian Weinstein, NBC NewsNoncitizen voting will force candidates to consider a broader set of issues\u201cThe West\u2019s resident foreigner communities are diverse. They include both indigent refugees and highly compensated expats, construction workers and software engineers, taxi drivers and bestselling authors. The political agendas they could advocate if they had a voice, and a vote, would include a correspondingly broad range of issues.\u201d \u2014 Leonid Bershidsky, BloombergNoncitizens will become more invested in their communities\u201cAllowing people to vote gives them even more of a sense of investment in their towns, cities, communities and country. There\u2019s a detachment that comes with not being able to vote in the place where you live. Concerns about mixed loyalties, meanwhile, are misplaced.\u201d \u2014 Atossa Araxia Abrahamian, New York TimesNoncitizen voting is an opportunity to counter attacks on voting rights\u201cIndeed, this celebration of democracy by expanding the right to vote is even more important now, after a raucous primary season and when reactionary forces in places like Georgia and Texas are trying to chip away at this precious right.\u201d \u2014 Murad Awawdeh, Daily NewsPlaces that enact noncitizen voting have been shown to benefit\u201cYou can move to Ireland and in six months vote in national elections. And they\u2019ve seen, you know, a significant turnout to good effect. There\u2019s a number of studies that have shown how when immigrants participate, there\u2019s increases in and improvements in education policy and outcomes.\u201d \u2014 Ron Hayduk, voting rights historian, The NationOpponentsNoncitizen voting rights would dilute the special bond citizens have with this country\u201cVoting in a modern democracy is tied to citizenship and the duties and rights that attend it, which is why the franchise is generally limited to those people who have established, either by birth or oath, a deep connection to the nation. Authorizing noncitizen voting would devalue citizenship, a bedrock of American life.\u201d \u2014 Seth Barron, City JournalDemocrats are trying to expand their voter base to tip elections in their favorNon-citizen voting is the latest push by progressives \u2014 along with felon voting and mass amnesty \u2014 who fear that they cannot win elections conducted only among law-abiding American citizens.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, National ReviewOne of the main arguments raised by supporters is illogical\u201cThe taxation argument isn\u2019t persuasive. Nonresidents with second homes or apartments in the city pay property taxes, and they certainly have an interest in public services like police, fire and garbage collection. International students live in New York, and they might pay taxes of all kinds, or at least sales taxes on whatever they buy. Does that mean they should get to vote in local races? The obvious answer is no.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, Wall Street JournalNoncitizen voting rights should start small\u201cThe expansion of the franchise should be narrow. It should be for school board elections only, and it could be restricted to legal permanent residents with children in the system. Let\u2019s try it and see what happens.\u201d \u2014 Nicholas Goldberg, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you\u2019d like to see covered in \u201cThe 360\u201d?
